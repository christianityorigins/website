1 Monism

Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality.

Monist religions are: Pythagorianism, Stocism, Platonism, Druidism, Vedism, Sufi Islam (Wahdat al-Wujud" which translates to "the unity of existence" or "the oneness of being").

2 Types of Monism 

There are different types of monism: materialistic monists (all is matter) believe that everything is made of matter, and even things like thoughts or consciousness are just products of physical processes. This view aligns with atheism. Idealistic monism (all is mind) is the opposite, where everything is fundamentally mental or spiritual, and the physical world is a manifestation of mind or consciousness. Neutral monism (a mix of both) posits that there's a single substance or principle from which both mind and matter arise, but it's neither purely mental nor purely physical. 

3 Scientific Basis

The scientific basis for monism lies in the concept of unity and interconnectedness, where everything is composed of the same fundamental building blocks, such as atoms and subatomic particles. This idea is supported by various scientific theories, including Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Causal Dynamical Triangulation, which suggest that the universe is ultimately made up of a single, underlying substance or reality. As a result, monism can be seen as a logical and coherent system that transcends religious or spiritual beliefs, making it accessible to even atheists who can appreciate the unity and simplicity of the natural world, without necessarily invoking supernatural or divine entities. \

4 Beliefs

in monist religions, monist cosmology posits that all phenomena reduces to one principle and the universe is composed of a single fundamental substance. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in monist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

Core Idea: Youâ€™re a piece of the cosmic puzzle, not a stranger to it. The divine is in everything; self-awareness is key.  

5 Rituals

In monist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are used to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and is aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality.
