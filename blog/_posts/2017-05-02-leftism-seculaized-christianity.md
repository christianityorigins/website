1 Secularization of Christianity\
  
As well as Christianity being a slave-morality system, Fredrich Nietzsche wrote that Liberalism is a secularized Christian political-theological religion (1). The Reformation coincided with the invention of the Gutenberg printing press which increased literacy and this is when a myriad of Protestant sects sprung forth: the Anabaptists, the Mennonites, the Amish, the Digger Movement, the Ranters, etc., all of whom adhered to a system of communism and preached about universalism and a utopia on earth. Marxism was one of these sects. The only difference is that Marxism was the first secularized Christian sect where the belief in a supernatural god was replaced with a belief in an omnipresent government. 

2 Marxism is Secularized Christianity  

_Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat."_ Marx and Engels, ‘Manifesto of the Communist Party’, Selected Works, Volume 1, p 56.
  
If Christianity laid the groundwork for slave morality, Marxism secularized its mechanisms into a political doctrine. Marxism is essentially a secularized Christian sect that replaces god with the government. The central organizing principle of classical Marxist economics, “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”, was lifted verbatim from the pages of the New Testament. Christianity’s universalist ethic; there is no longer Jew or Greek, slave or free” (Galatians 3:28), is mirrored in Marxism’s call for a classless society that transcends national, ethnic, and cultural boundaries. Communal property comes from Acts 4:32-35" "For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need". Marx's historical materialism (theory of history) is the eschatological framework of Christian orthodoxy in secularized form. Christian salvation is Marxian emancipation. The Marxist obsession with labor mirrors Christian veneration of toil (e.g., "by the sweat of your brow"). Marxism glorifies the downtrodden as virtuous, similar to Christianity’s Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12). Also, Marxism is built on the philosophy of liberation and universalism (2) and preys on the impoverished and outcastes of society by promising them a future utopia through the triumph of the proletariat. Marxism, like christianity, is also dogmatic and sectarian; both exalt collectivism over individualism; both justify violence as a catalyst for social change; both prohibit private property; "take from the rich to give to the poor", and "may the last be first", etc. If you strip away the Marxian narrative you will see that at its core it is the exact same christian divide-and-conquer population control system that is designed to weaponize the resentment of the lower classes for the overthrow of society. This is not a coincidence. Influenced by his teacher Bruno Bauer who wrote extensively about how Leftism was a secular christian cult, Karl Marx approached a Christian communist group called the 'League of the Just' (18) and got them to finance him while he came up with an atheist-compatible sect of christianity.  
  
3 Marxist Denominations and the Frankfurt School

  

Marxism is a secularized sect of Christianity that sees class as the main cause for inequality. Critical Theory is a Marxist sect that replaces class with culture as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Cultural Marxism"). Critical Race Theory is a Marxist sect that replaces class with race as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Race Marxism"), and Third Wave Feminism is a Marxist sect that replaces class with gender as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Gender Marxism"). There is overlap between these Marxist sects, and this is called "intersectionality" in academia. For example, feminists teach that class, culture, race and gender all combined (usually encapsulated through "White") are the structural causes of inequality. Marxism’s splintering into sects (e.g., Leninism, Maoism) mirrors Christianity’s denominational schisms.\
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       The Frankfurt School in Germany were Christian heretics. They took Marx's secularized Christianity and created various sects of it (culture, race, gender, "white"). Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno’s "Dialectic of Enlightenment" secularized Christian guilt into cultural critique. Herbert Marcuse’s "Repressive Tolerance" mirrors Christian martyrdom as he taught that oppressors must tolerate their own destruction. Marcuse argues that true tolerance in an oppressive society requires intolerance toward prevailing policies, attitudes, opinions” of the dominant class, while giving preferential treatment to marginalized voices. These jews became the figureheads behind the 'New Left' social movement in the 1960's. This is when the lefts focus on individual liberty and economics was replaced with identity politics and social justice (cultural marxism). But the conditions that allowed for this movement to grow were already present in the culture with roots in christianity, they just secularized it.

  

4 Modern Manifestations: Wokeness as Christian Heirloom

  

Marxism, Critical Theory, Critical Race Theory, Leftism/Wokeism all incorporate the same ethics, metaphors, symbols and meanings that originate in Christianty.

  

*   White guilt/privilege/fragility/et.al. = Christian Original Sin.
*   Monotheism = the binary opposition between good and evil (left vs. right). A singular truth in Christianity (one God, one truth) mirrors the left's ideological stance where there's often a clear delineation of right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, progressive vs. regressive. The moral superiority that white leftists often claim is rooted in this dualistic worldview.
*   White saviorism = Messianism: The idea of white people as moral saviors or messianic figures echoes religious concepts of a redeemer or savior. Many white leftists see themselves as engaging in a divine mission to eradicate racism or save or redeem non-white people.
*   Social activism = Christian mission. The cultural exportation of "Western values" where "whiteness" is the new gospel.
*   Virtue signaling = Christian penance.
*   Publicly exhibiting self-hate/self-flagellating = christian piety signaling. In christianity, genuflection, self-abasement, and self-abnegation are necessary prerequisites for spiritual purity and cleansing. This is expressed as "mortification of the flesh". For 2000 years, Europeans have been rewarded for piety signaling, i.e., displaying self-hate, confession, self-flagellation, etc., and punished for not displaying these things. This is also a form of narcissistic self-sacrifice that is inspired by a suffering servant deity.
*   Salvation/atonement (through accepting jesus and admitting sin) = accepting Leftism and admitting privilege.
*   "Whiteness" = Christian Universalism ("Christendom"). The idea that self-identifying as "white" makes one a representative, spokesperson, or judge of the behavior of the entire group aligns with universalist ideologies where a single entity or belief system is seen as encompassing all humanity. "White" is downstream from the universalist christian identity of "christendom".
*   Race/IQ/gender/genetics denialism ("Boasian anthropology") = "all equal in Jesus".
*   Moralization of Weakness = Leftism, like Christianity, frames weakness or marginalization as inherently virtuous, granting moral authority to the “oppressed” over the “privileged.”. This inverts natural hierarchies, empowering the resentful to dominate through guilt rather than strength.
*   Sanctification of the Marginalized as Sacred: Leftism elevates marginalized groups (e.g., racial minorities, LGBTQ+) to a quasi-sacred status, akin to Christianity’s veneration of the “poor in spirit” or “meek.”. This creates a moral hierarchy where the “oppressed” wield authority over the “privileged,” inverting natural power dynamics.
*   Collective Guilt as Control = Concepts like “white guilt” or “colonial guilt” replicate Christian original sin, imposing collective responsibility on entire groups to enforce compliance.
*   Political Correctness = Heresy.
*   Cancel culture = witch-hunts/excommunicated for heresy.
*   Adopting labels and slogans (pronouns, BLM, trans ally, etc.) = bearing the mark, or taking up the cross. This is equivalent to wearing a cross or crucifix as a visible sign of one's faith and signaling to others that they are a member of the community. They gain social capital in progressive circles through this. 
*   Government = God. An omnipresent entitlement and benefactor giver.

What is the end goal of these divide-and-conquer slave-morality systems? (Christianity/Marxism/Cultural Marxism/Race Marxism/Gender Marxism). "Progress" (deconstruction/abolition) is the weaponizing the poor, outcastes, racial groups and women to get them to overthrow the dominant group in society and then create a slave class controlled by a tiny elite. Why? Friedrich Nietzsche claimed that all these slave-moralities were the manifestations of a Jewish group strategy/essentialist racial instincts operating below the level of real consciousness \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#Jews,_nationalism_and_European_identity)\].

_Addendum_

My critique of leftism was not coming from a conservative perspective. Leftism is a secularized variant of protestantism (puritanism), but conservatism is secularized catholicism with its focus on hierarcy and tradtion. Western left vs. right politics is a relict of abrahamic monotheism.
