### Revisionist History

I am interested in revisionist history. These are some of my notes that I will expand on eventually.

##### Who Was Behind the Conspiracy to Rewrite History?

Most ancient history as it is taught today was filterd through the Church Fathers, Vatican, and Jesuits. Joseph Justus Scalinger, and Poggio Bracciolini who was the guy who collected documents for him and even forged them (there are preserved letters from Bracciolini arranging a forgery with a remote monastery), are credited with "discovering" around 80% of the European history texts that we are taught from today, usually on demand. 

There was another Jesuit named Jean Hardouin who said that a 14th Century conspiracy forged practically all literature traditionally believed to have been written before that era. He was the official librarian to the King of France. He published a book called the Prolegomena and it caused such controversy that the Pope and the King had him come before them and explain himself. He defended his work, and refused to retract it, so they threw him in prison.


The Vatican burned the Library of Alexandria... twice!

The mainstream claim is that the library was destroyed by Julius Caesar (48 BC) or Muslim conquest (642 AD). The truth is that the final and most devastating burn was ordered by Pope Theophilus in 391 AD to erase Serapis cult texts that exposed Christianity’s origins. Proof: The Nag Hammadi Library (1945) contained Gnostic texts that matched Serapis theology—proving a cover-up, and the "Letter of Hadrian to Servianus" (found in Vindobonensis manuscript) admits: "Those who worship Serapis are Christians… devotees of Serapis call themselves bishops of Christ."
 
Theodosius I also destroyed the Serapeum in Alexandria (referred to as the daughter of the Library of Alexandria) in 391 AD. Serapis statues were recarved into "St. Peter".

The Vatican also made up the "Council of Nicaea". It never Happened. There is no contemporary records exist of the Council of Nicaea (325 AD). The earliest mention comes from Athanasius 60 years later. The Nicene Creed was backdated. The first full version appears in 381 AD (Council of Constantinople). Constantine’s "conversion" was fabricated. He remained a Sol Invictus sun-worshipper until death—his coins never feature Christian symbols. The "Arian Controversy" was a fake debate to disguise the fact that early Christianity was a Roman imperial cult. Proof: The "Life of Constantine" by Eusebius was forged in the 5th century to retroactively justify Nicaea, and the Edict of Milan (313 AD) never mentions Jesus—only a vague "Divine Providence". Also, the Vatican's greatest forgery was the Donation of Constantine. The Vatican forged it in the 8th century to claim Rome. It was based on earlier forgeries by Eusebius (a Flavian propagandist).

There were other figures, like Joseph Needham whose writings on Chinese history are the reference point that were use today, and William Jones who rewrote indian history. 

#### Alexander the Great

Alexander finished his conquest of India and continued on throughout China. Only the identity of "Alexander" died at 33, he then assumed local identities. 

A non-mainstream version of history, but one that is recorded in
    Persian ('Iskandarnameh', or Book of Alexander and 'Shahnameh') and Islamic sources [1], is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince named Bubares who was the son of Artaxerxes
    II Memnon (Kai Bahman), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon' [2]
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'. He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta (Alexander is Iksander in Persian and
    "Alakshandra" in Sanskrit and Gupta means 'guardian' or 'protector'
    in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). Evidence of this is
    that the Sanskrit language might be a dialect of Avestan, or a
    Hellenized variant of Avestan, and the similarities of customs and
    religions [3]. Also, there is strong evidence that Alexander's
    successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, ruled India with the
    regional identity of Ashoka the Great [4]. See: Alexander Romance
    [5], The life of Alexander of Macedon [6], and Alexander the
    Great: Beyond the Divide by Charles N. Pope [7].

Bubares (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubares) was a Persian prince who married Alexander's sister. They had a son named Amyntas (son of Bubares) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_(son_of_Bubares)). He was the king of the city Phrygia that was located in Galatia in classical Anatolia. Further down the line there was an Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_of_Galatia) who ruled an empire that streched from modern day Turkey through India. [[link](https://ranajitpal-jesus-from-asia-minor.blogspot.com/2011/06/jesus-christ-was-amyntas-of-galatia_20.html)]

Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia was married to Stratonice who was the sister of Asander, king of Bosphorus (who I identify as Julius Caesar's real identity). He was also the cousin of Dynamis, Asander's wife who I identify as Celopatra's real identity.

A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17
BCE), refers to as Asander as the 'Great King of Kings Asandros
Philoromaios Soter' (Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani 30). So, he
was a 'King of Kings', Soter (savior), and 'The Great'. Individually,
each of those titles carry significance, but the 'Great King of Kings'
title in that inscription stands out because it is a rare title that was
used by Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great. This shows Asanders
level of prestige and power because he was the direct descendant of Cyrus and Alexander.

Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who also carried the
title "King of Kings". Her uncle was Mithridates 'Chrestus'

Mithridates VI Eupator was a direct descendant of Ptolemy II Philadelphus: Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285-246 BCE) married Arsinoe I, and they had a daughter, Berenice Syra. Berenice Syra married Antiochus II Theos, a Seleucid king, and they had a son, Seleucus II Callinicus. Seleucus II Callinicus (246-225 BCE) married Laodice II, and they had a daughter, Laodice III. Laodice III married Mithridates III of Pontus, and they had a son, Pharnaces I of Pontus. Pharnaces I of Pontus (190-155 BCE) married Nysa, and they had a son, Mithridates V of Pontus. Mithridates V of Pontus (150-120 BCE) married Laodice VI, and they had a son, Mithridates VI Eupator (120-63 BCE)). This would make Asander (whose name is an obvious reference to Alexander) and Dynamis Alexander's heirs.

#### China

The Tarim basin mummies are Tocharians, and the Kizilgaha cave portraits deprict redheaded "Chinese" people. Genetic studies show that indegenous people of Linzi in south east China were genetically more similar to Europeans than modern Chinese (https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2017/07/north-european-admixture-in-han-chinese.html). Tang dynasty mural in tomb unearthed in China portrays a 'Westerner' man with blond hair (https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/stunning-tang-dynasty-mural-in-tomb-unearthed-in-china-may-portray-a-westerner-man-with-blond-hair).

Alexander the Great = Liu Bang (256 BCE), founder of the Han dynasty in China.

Qin was founded by Greco-Bactrians and Seleucid "Greek" diaspora, it starts right exactly around the Greco-Bactrian city states era in Central Asia, it was started by people coming from the West right exactly bordering Central Asia during Greco-Bactrian rule, DA-QIN meaning BIG OR GREATER QIN as a word name term was used to refer to the Roman empire during the "Han dynasty" that came after Qin dynasty which means the QIN people had to have been Greco-Bactrian Seleucids since they equated with Roman type people and they came from the farthest West direction. Greek style coins and statues have been found from this time period, and the terracotta army was built by Greeks from Central Asia [8], to this day the Chinese currency which came about formally during Qin dynasty era is called a YUAN which is another name for YON-IONIAN Greeks etc. 

China had no chronology until the Jesuits came to the Emperor's court. Their oldest "ancient" records date from this period. Stone inscriptions and bronze engravings and a few bamboo slips survive from older times, but they were never arranged into a consistent chronology. If you read the Bellum Tartaricum, a pre-edit Jesuit source, it gives a very different chronology as well as info about the white Slav-like race known as the Tartarians, their rulers and their wars with China.

Mateo Ricci was the one who wrote the Art of War.

The modern "Han Chinese" are not infact "Chinese" ("Chinese" is a identity concept fabricated and conjured up by Jesuits) but are infact Miao-Hmong people. Mao-tse Dong used artificial weaponized famines and outright direct purges to direct human wave attacks in the Korean war to mass kill off original Scythian Tartar Turanian stock authentic real "Chinese" populations which is continuing today with the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Uighurs and Mongolians whom are far more genetically ancestrally connected and linked to the original real actual ancient "Chinese" rather than a vast majority of modern "Han Chinese" whom are actually Miao-Hmong or Miao-Tse or Hmong or Yao or other southern origin non-"Chinese" group pretending to be "Chinese"

The An Lushan rebellion was an ethnic war, mongoloids vs caucasoids which resulted the slaughter of millions of caucasians. The Xianbei were mongoloids and helped rape and sexually enslave Indo Europeans in China in the An Lushan rebellion. Goguryeo Korean general Gao Juren in the Tang dynasty committed genocide and rape against An Lushan's community after defeating An Lushan at his headquarters in Fanyang (Beijing).

Similarly, Ran Min slaughtered and committed genocide on the entire Caucasian Jie people who were native to Chin.

The Manchus had the Central Asian Indo-European children castrated. Manchu officials ordered British and American sailors who violated rules in ports executed before the Opium wars and had British and Indian sailors on the Nerbudda mass executed. The Manchus castrated and sliced up Indo-european Caucasians. The Manchus also raped caucasian women.

#### Europe

Most of what we know of Roman history comes from Herodotus (aka The Father of Lies), and the other half from Cassius Dio.

Two other men are responsible for most of what we know about the rest of European history from the middle ages and before: Joseph Justus Scaliger who was the Jesuit who "authored" most texts historians use today (possibly had a team of scribes), and Poggio Bracciolini was the guy who collected documents for him and even forged them (there are preserved letters from Bracciolini arranging a forgery with a remote monastery).

Ancient Rome in Italy, in its surviving monuments and buildings, is a Middle Ages construction. The "first Rome" was based out of classical Anatolia [9]. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. The word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called "Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn" ("Kingdom of the Romans"), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the "new History" that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    
Sir Isaac Newton, in his book "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended" (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand.
    
Charlemagne was not a real person, but one of the phantom individuals the Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Pletho (or Plethon) were one
    and the same person. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun (who was actually Priscus Attalus) were the same person.
    The Black Plague/Great Plague/Black Death/Bubonic Plague (it's
    a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed "Dark Ages") is
    exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. The Trojan War and the Crusades were the same conflict. 

#### India

The Harappan civilization (Indus Valley civilization) was founded by Neolithic (Med) people from Iran. The "Aryan invasion into India" theory probably never happened. The R1a haplotye, Sanskrit language (Avestan language that was Hellinized), and Vedism (Druidism) came from the Persians and Greeks (who military would have been mostly Dorians).

Alexander the Great = Chandragupta (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). [<a href="https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]

Diodotus I Soter = Ashoka the Great. [<a href="https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]

The name Abaris or Abharas, from Abaris the Hyperborian, the teacher of Pythagoras, derives from the Old Irish word abhar, which means chief or noble and was a generic term for Druid or Chief Druid. Abharas is also related to the Sanskrit word Bhārata, a legendary king in the Vedas. Bhārata is at the root of the word Bharatvarsha which is a term that is used to refer to the Indian subcontinent as a whole. 

Alexander the Great was the "Ram god" who is Ramas in the Vedas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_of_Alexander. Alexander is also identified as the Islamic prophet Dhu al-Qurnayn - He of Two Horns. His name comes from coins depicting him as Zeus Ammon, a two-horned pagan god).

Up to 2000 years ago Indians were a Neolithic and Aryan race with a small minority of Australo-Melanesians existing (Denisovans, similar to Australian Aborignines).

The Dravidians of India are Ethiopians who the jews imported to India via South India and Sri Lanka to work as
    slaves in the spice trade and in the marble mines. From Ethiopia it is a straight line route to Sri Lanka via
    boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves were likely jewish male - Ethiopian female slaves (i.e. the males were castrated), hence why modern Indians have a similar physiognomy to jews, who then mixed with indigenous Neolithic/Aryans (consentually or by force?). [10]\

1 In the Shahnameh, Dara (Darius) is said to have married the daughter of Philip of Macedon, and was the father of Alexander. Dara's father is said to be Bahman, and his uncle Sasan (the progenitor of the Sassanians). This same basic story is told several centuries earlier in the Kar-namag e Ardashir. \
--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Bahman">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Bahman</a>\
--Artaxerxes II Memnon was married to Stateira. Alexander was also married to a Stateira who was sometimes called Barsine. Barsine and Berenice are different forms of the Persian name Barsina. The Persian name Roshanak is translated as Barsina, so the names Barsine and Berenice are both related to the Roxana, which was the name of Alexander's Persian wife. Barsine's father Artabazus was Satrap (govenor) of Phrygia (in west-central Anatolia).

10 According to Strabo (II.5.12), by the time of Augustus, up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India:  
"At any rate, when Gallus was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the Nile as far as Syene and the frontiers of Ethiopia, and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from Myos Hormos to India, whereas formerly, under the Ptolemies, only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise." — Strabo II.5.12.

(for reference: during the transatlantic slave trade 100 ships sailed each year transporting 15 million Africans to the Americas)
