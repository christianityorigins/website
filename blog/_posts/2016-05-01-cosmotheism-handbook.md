1 Cosmotheism

Cosmotheism is the philosophical and spiritual view that the universe itself is divine and that all existence is interconnected within this cosmic whole. It posits that the cosmos is not merely a backdrop for life but is a living, conscious entity in which everything is an expression of the divine. This perspective encourages a deep appreciation for nature and the universe as sacred.

2 Types of Cosmotheism

There are different interpretations of cosmotheism:

-Naturalistic cosmotheism: This view sees the universe as a natural phenomenon, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things without invoking supernatural elements. It aligns closely with scientific naturalism and can resonate with atheistic perspectives. 
  
-Spiritual cosmotheism: This interpretation embraces a more mystical view, suggesting that the universe is imbued with a spiritual dimension, or a divine consciousness. It emphasizes the spiritual dimensions of existence and the idea that the cosmos is a manifestation of a greater divine reality.

3 Scientific Basis

The scientific basis for cosmotheism lies in the concept of unity and interconnectedness, where everything is composed of the same fundamental building blocks, such as atoms and subatomic particles. This idea is supported by various scientific theories, including Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Causal Dynamical Triangulation, which suggest that the universe is ultimately made up of an underlying substance or reality. \

4 Beliefs

In cosmotheist religions, cosmotheist cosmology posits that the universe is imbued with a spiritual dimension. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in cosmotheist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

Core Idea: Youâ€™re a piece of the cosmic puzzle, not a stranger to it. The divine is in everything; self-awareness is key.  

5 Rituals

In cosmotheist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are used to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and is aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality.

Addendum

1 This is just a simple explanatory framework of this religion. In a collective sense, traditions, shared identity, and group strategy/goals are built over this core. You can read more about this here:

2 Many modern secular Pagans (1) are inspired by Carl Jung who combined psychoanalysis with Paganism. Jungian philosophy applies to cosmotheism as the universe becomes an expression of the collective unconscious (2) with archetypes (3) manifesting as symbolic or divine personifications/symbolic representations within it. To to these Pagans, rituals are ways of inducing 'active imagination' (4) or a part of the process of 'individuation' (5).
