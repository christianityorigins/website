1 Cosmotheism

Cosmotheism is the philosophical and spiritual view that the universe itself is divine and that all existence is interconnected within this cosmic whole. It posits that the cosmos is not merely a backdrop for life but is a living, conscious entity in which everything is an expression of the divine. This perspective encourages a deep appreciation for nature and the universe as sacred.

2 Types of Cosmotheism

There are different interpretations of the cosmotheist cosmology, but here are two:

-   Naturalistic cosmotheism: This is the core atheist-compatible path. It strictly adheres to the scientific method and metaphysical naturalism (nothing exists beyond the natural, physical universe). The "divine" is a metaphor for the universe's totality, complexity, and the emergent property of consciousness within it. Reverence is directed at the real, knowable cosmos. 
  
-   Spiritual cosmotheism: This interpretation embraces a more mystical view, suggesting that the universe is imbued with a spiritual dimension, or a divine consciousness (panpsychism). It emphasizes the spiritual dimensions of existence and the idea that the cosmos is a manifestation of a greater divine reality.

3 Scientific Basis

The scientific basis for cosmotheism lies in the concept of unity and interconnectedness, where everything is composed of the same fundamental building blocks, such as atoms and subatomic particles. We are literally made of stardust. This narrative provides a "cosmic genealogy".

4 Beliefs

In cosmotheist religions, cosmotheist cosmology posits that the universe is imbued with a spiritual dimension. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in cosmotheist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

Core Idea: You’re a piece of the cosmic puzzle, not a stranger to it. The divine is in everything; self-awareness is key. Self-realization in cosmotheism is not just personal growth but an alignment with the universe’s evolutionary drive toward greater complexity and consciousness.

5 Practices and Observances

In cosmotheist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, stargazing to reflect on cosmic unity, and engaging in scientific inquiry to deepen understanding are all ways to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and is aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality, fostering a sense of unity with the universe.
