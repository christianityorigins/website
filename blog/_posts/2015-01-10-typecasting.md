This reference guide to the many aliases of Alexander (grandson of King Herod)—also known as Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea, Alexander Lysimachus, Alexander the Alabarch, Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, Ptolemy of Mauretania, Phraates V, and Monobazus I, King of Adiabene—as well as his sister-wife Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX, Pythodorida Philometor, Helene, Drusilla of Mauretania, Julia Ourania of Parthia, and Philo of Alexandria, together with their two sons Tiberius Julius Alexander and Marcus Julius Alexander, served as the starting point of my research. I consider this chart important enough to preserve for posterity.

Note: Asander of Bosphorus = Julius Caesar, Dynamis = Cleopatra, Mark Antony = King Herod, so that chart confuses some of their aliases with those of Cleopatra and Mark Antony’s grandchildren. Nevertheless, it provided my initial framework for understanding the complex web of identities this family employed

# Magdalene's Men

### The historic identities of the many men in Mary Magdalene's life.

Mary Magdalene was accused of "having many men." She was labeled "A Prostitute." Her "many men," were in fact, her one and only husband who is known to history under several aliases. It was the only way to preserve his real identity while also returning the lands of his birthright to him. He was the grandson of Herod the Great and Hasmonean princess, Mariamme, giving him the right to be called, *King of Judea, King of the Jews*. Judea had once been a part of Arabia, which encompassed the Parthian Empire, the Kingdoms of Media, Adiabene, Persia, Armenia, Edessa, Cappadocia, Commagene, Cilicia and Syria. *By the end of his life he had become "King" of all those lands - and so very much more!*
