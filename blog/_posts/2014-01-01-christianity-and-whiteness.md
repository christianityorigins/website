Beyond the Immanent Frame: 'Whiteness' as Secularized Christendom and the Case for Ethnic Particularity

By Ralph Perrier

This post I read recently inspired my thinking, and it connects back to the book I wrote about how leftism is a secularized variant of Christianity.

Key points:

-"White" is a secularized, pseudo-religious identity with spokespersons and commandments.\
-The "white" label is an empty, universalist category about power, not heritage.\
-Modern secular morality (good vs. evil, care for the oppressed) is a Christian inheritance.\
-Rejecting "white" for specific ethnic subtypes breaks a modern power structure.

From Christ's Body to the White Body Politic.

Medieval Christendom conceived of itself as a universal body—the corpus Christianum. It was a totalizing identity that subsumed ethnic differences (Goth, Frank, Saxon) under a higher, spiritual unity defined by a common belief and moral law. To be outside this body was to be "other," and authority was derived from speaking for and defending this universal flock.

The modern invention of "whiteness" performs an identical sociological function. It is a universalist category that demands individuals of European descent shed their specific ethnic histories—Celtic, Germanic, Slavic, Mediterranean—to become members of a new, broad body defined not by faith, but by a power relationship. As you note, "White = no ethnic or national identity, no history, no culture, no race. You sacrifice all those things to be white." This is the required renunciation, the first act of faith in the new secular creed.

The Christian moral framework, however, remains intact at its core. The monotheistic dichotomy of absolute good versus evil is secularized into a relentless political binary. The concept of original sin is translated into the innate, inherited guilt of "white privilege." The call to confession and penance manifests in public rituals of acknowledgment, deference, and the ceding of authority. The figure of the heretic is no longer the unbeliever, but the "racist" or the "unwoke" who rejects the new dogma. Salvation is no longer found in grace, but in achieving a state of enlightened "anti-racism," often signaled through performative disavowals of the very "white" identity the speaker inhabits.

This is where the observation about the "spokesperson" becomes critical. Within Christendom, priests, bishops, and theologians held the authority to interpret doctrine, define sin, and guide the flock toward salvation. In the secular religion of whiteness, a similar clerical class emerges: the self-appointed ambassador of "the whites".

When an individual prefaces a statement with "As a white person...," they are not making a simple demographic observation. They are assuming a pastoral role. They are speaking ex cathedra for the entire body of the faithful, diagnosing its collective sin, and prescribing the path to atonement. This grants them immense moral authority—the authority of the repentant sinner leading other sinners—and empowers them to enforce the new commandments. This performance, as you astutely call it, is the primary "way to signal their piety." It is virtue, sanctified by the secular church.

Therefore, the call to self-identify with specific European subtypes like "Celto-Germanic" or "Anglo-Germanic" instead of the monolithic "white" is more than a strategic move for legal or political advantage. It is a direct challenge to a powerful modern identity that functions as a secularized form of Christendom. This argument finds its basis in the fact that core modern values—like universal human dignity, a concern for the marginalized, and a strong sense of good versus evil—are not universal human defaults but are the unique inheritance of the Christian revolution.

If “whiteness” is simply Christendom stripped of Christ, then rejecting it is not an act of rebellion but an act of clarity. It is a refusal to let a secularized moral empire dictate the terms of identity, guilt, and redemption. Reclaiming ethnic particularity is a way of stepping outside the universal body politic that modernity has built atop Christian foundations. It is a way of remembering that real peoples existed before the abstraction of “white”, and that they can exist again once the spell of the secular church is broken.
