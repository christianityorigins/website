1 Pythagoreanism

There are only three things that you need to know to understand Pythagoreanism:

1.1 Cosmology

Pythagorian cosmology is monism \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)\]. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter (1)). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality.

1.2 Beliefs

Monist cosmology posits that all phenomena reduces to one principle and the universe is composed of a single fundamental substance. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in monist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

1.3 Rituals

In monist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals and practices like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are used to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and are aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality.

Addendum

Pythagoreanism was the nucleus for most ancient European religions. Pythagoras was a student of Abaris the Hyperborean and the religion of the ancient Romans was created by Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, who was a student of Pythagoras. That is probably why all these ancient religions are analogous. "And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this philosophy" -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus. Diodorus Siculus, Book V, ยง26-32 (36 BCE), and Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor, among other contemporaneous sources, also refer to the Druids as "Pythagorean". So, add in ethnic traditions and holidays to the above framework and you have a reconstruction of your ethnic religion.

1\. There are different types of monism: materialistic monists believe that everything is made of matter, and even things like thoughts or consciousness are just products of physical processes. Physicalist monism is a variant of materialistic monism where everything is ultimately physical or dependent on physical states. This view aligns with atheism. Idealistic monism is the opposite, where everything is fundamentally mental or spiritual, and the physical world is a manifestation of mind or consciousness. Neutral monism posits that there's a single substance or principle from which both mind and matter arise, but it's neither purely mental nor purely physical. Pantheistic monism posits that the universe, nature, or the cosmos itself is identical with the divine or God. Ancient European religions were Dharmic (non-dogmatic), so the cosmology was always left up to the follower. This is also seen in Vedism. The important thing is that the beliefs and rituals promoted tradition, a shared culture, and a sense of community. \
