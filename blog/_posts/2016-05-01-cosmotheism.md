1 Definition

Cosmotheism is the belief that there is a spiritual or transcendent aspect to the universe (cosmos) and the universe and the divine are interconnected, viewing the cosmos as a manifestation of the divine presence. It emphasizes the sacredness of the universe and often incorporates ideas of spiritual evolution and consciousness. 

2 Cosmology

Cosmotheist cosmology revolves around the belief that the universe and the divine are interconnected, often seeing the cosmos as a manifestation of a higher spiritual presence. It emphasizes that reality is not separate from the sacred but is an evolving expression of it. 

Essentially it is about seeing divinity in the universe, laws of physics, etc. 

There are also materialistic cosmotheists (all is matter) who believe that everything is made of matter, and even things like thoughts or consciousness are just products of physical processes. This view aligns with atheism. These cosmotheists just appreciate the interconnectedness of the universe without ascribing any supernatural power to it. 

3 Core Beliefs

In cosmotheist religions, cosmotheist cosmology posits that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in cosmotheist cosmology, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

4 Practices and Rituals

In cosmotheist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are used to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and is aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality.

Addenum

Another way to look at cosmotheist cosmology is through the lens of Nietzschean philosophy where the "will to power" \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power)\] becomes the driving force behind the unfolding of the universe, and by extension, human existence. The single fundamental substance or reality that underlies cosmotheist cosmology is not just a passive, inert entity, but a dynamic, self-overcoming force that perpetually strives to express itself, to manifest its own power. The will to power is a force that courses through the universe, driving it towards ever greater heights of complexity. Humans, as manifestations of this divine force, are not separate from it, but rather, they are the focal points of its self-expression, the conduits through which the universe realizes its own potential.\
