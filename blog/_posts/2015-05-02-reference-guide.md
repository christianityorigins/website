### Revisionist History

Alexander the great finished his conquest of India and continued on throughout China. Only the identity of "Alexander" died at 33, he then assumed local identities. 

China

Qin was founded by Greco-Bactrians and Seleucid "Greek" diaspora, it starts right exactly around the Greco-Bactrian city states era in Central Asia, it was started by people coming from the West right exactly bordering Central Asia during Greco-Bactrian rule, DA-QIN meaning BIG OR GREATER QIN as a word name term was used to refer to the Roman empire during the "Han dynasty" that came after Qin dynasty which means the QIN people had to have been Greco-Bactrian Seleucids since they equated with Roman type people and they came from the farthest West direction. Greek style coins and statues have been found from this time period, and the terracotta army was built by Greeks from Central Asia [1], to this day the Chinese currency which came about formally during Qin dynasty era is called a YUAN which is another name for YON-IONIAN Greeks etc. 

China had no chronology until the Jesuits came to the Emperor's court. Their oldest "ancient" records date from this period. Stone inscriptions and bronze engravings and a few bamboo slips survive from older times, but they were never arranged into a consistent chronology. If you read the Bellum Tartaricum, a pre-edit Jesuit source, it gives a very different chronology as well as info about the white Slav-like race known as the Tartarians, their rulers and their wars with China.

Mateo Ricci was the one who wrote the Art of War.

Europe

Most of what we know of Roman history comes from Herodotus (aka The Father of Lies), and the other half from Cassius Dio.

Two other men are responsible for most of what we know of the rest of European history: Joseph Justus Scalinger Scaliger was the Jesuit who "authored" most texts historians use today (possibly had scribes), and Poggio Bracciolini was the guy who collected documents for him and even forged them (there are preserved letters from Bracciolini arranging a forgery with a remote monastery).

Ancient Rome in Italy, in its surviving monuments and buildings, was a Middle Ages construction. The "first Rome" was based out of Anatolia [2]. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. The word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called "Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn" ("Kingdom of the Romans"), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the "new History" that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    
Sir Isaac Newton, in his book "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended" (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand.
    
Charlemagne was not a real person, but one of the phantom individuals the Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same person. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same person.
    The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic Plague (it's
    a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed "Dark Ages") is
    exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. The Trojan War and the Crusades were the same conflict. 

India

The Harappan civilization (Indus Valley civilization) was founded by Neolithic (Med) people from Iran. The "Aryan invasion into India" theory probably never happened. The R1a haplotye, Sanskrit language (Avestan language that was Hellinized), and Vedism (Druidism) came from the Persians and Greeks (who military would have been mostly Dorians).


Alexander the Great = Chandragupta (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). [<a href="https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]

Diodotus I Soter = Ashoka the Great. [<a href="https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]

The name Abaris or Abharas, from Abaris the Hyperborian, the teacher of Pythagoras, derives from the Old Irish word abhar, which means chief or noble and was a generic term for Druid or Chief Druid. Abharas is also related to the Sanskrit word Bhārata, a legendary king in the Vedas. Bhārata is at the root of the word Bharatvarsha which is a term that is used to refer to the Indian subcontinent as a whole. 

Alexander the Great was the "Ram god" who is Ramas in the Vedas.

Up to 2000 years ago Indians were a Neolithic and Aryan race.

The Dravidians of India are Ethiopians who the jews imported to India via South India and Sri Lanka to work as
    slaves in the spice trade and in the marble mines. From Ethiopia it is a straight line route to Sri Lanka via
    boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves were likely jewish male - Ethiopian female slaves (i.e. the males were castrated), hence why modern Indians have a similar physiognomy to jews, who then mixed with indigenous Neolithic/Aryans (consentually or by force?). [3]\

Most ancient history as it is taught today was filterd through the Jesuits. Most Jesuits, including their founder Ignatius Loyola, were marrano/converso jews [4]. Joseph Justus Scalinger alone was credited with "discovering" around 80% of the European history texts that we are taught from today, usually on demand. Most history books from antiquity display Europeans in a negative light, jews as victims, and European triumphs are downplayed. This is probably why. 

*A non-mainstream version of history, but one that is recorded in
    Persian and Islamic sources [5], is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince (Bupares) who was the son of Kai Bahman (Artaxerxes
    II Memnon), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon' [6]
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'. He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta (Alexander is Iksander in Persian and
    "Alakshandra" in Sanskrit and Gupta means 'guardian' or 'protector'
    in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). Evidence of this is
    that the Sanskrit language might be a dialect of Avestan, or a
    Hellenized variant of Avestan, and the similarities of customs and
    religions [7]. Also, there is strong evidence that Alexander's
    successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, ruled India with the
    regional identity of Ashoka the Great [8]. See: Alexander Romance
    [9], The life of Alexander of Macedon [10], and Alexander the
    Great: Beyond the Divide by Charles N. Pope [11].\

3 According to Strabo (II.5.12), by the time of Augustus, up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India:  
"At any rate, when Gallus was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the Nile as far as Syene and the frontiers of Ethiopia, and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from Myos Hormos to India, whereas formerly, under the Ptolemies, only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise." — Strabo II.5.12.

(for reference: during the transatlantic slave trade 100 ships sailed each year transporting 15 million Africans to the Americas)
