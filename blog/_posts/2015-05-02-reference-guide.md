### Revisionist History

Alexander the great finished his conquest of India and continued on throughout China. Only the identity of "Alexander" died at 33, he then assumed local identities. 

China

Qin was founded by Greco-Bactrians and Seleucid "Greek" diaspora, it starts right exactly around the Greco-Bactrian city states era in Central Asia, it was started by people coming from the West right exactly bordering Central Asia during Greco-Bactrian rule, DA-QIN meaning BIG OR GREATER QIN as a word name term was used to refer to the Roman empire during the "Han dynasty" that came after Qin dynasty which means the QIN people had to have been Greco-Bactrian Seleucids since they equated with Roman type people and they came from the farthest West direction. Greek style coins and statues have been found from this time period, and the terracotta army was built by Greeks from Central Asia (1), to this day the Chinese currency which came about formally during Qin dynasty era is called a YUAN which is another name for YON-IONIAN Greeks etc. 
   
India

The Harappan civilization (Indus Valley civilization) was founded by Neolithic (Med) people from Iran. The "Aryan invasion into India" theory probably never happened. The R1a haplotye, Sanskrit language (Avestan language that was Hellinized), and Vedism (Druidism) came from the Persians and Greeks (who military would have been mostly Dorians).


Alexander the Great = Chandragupta (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). [<a href="https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]

Diodotus I Soter = Ashoka the Great. [<a href="https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]

The name Abaris or Abharas, from Abaris the Hyperborian, the teacher of Pythagoras, derives from the Old Irish word abhar, which means chief or noble and was a generic term for Druid or Chief Druid. Abharas is also related to the Sanskrit word Bhārata, a legendary king in the Vedas. Bhārata is at the root of the word Bharatvarsha which is a term that is used to refer to the Indian subcontinent as a whole. 

Alexander the Great was the "Ram god" who is Ramas in the Vedas.

Up to 2000 years ago Indians were a Neolithic and Aryan race.

The Dravidians of India are Ethiopians who the jews imported to India via South India and Sri Lanka to work as
    slaves in the spice trade and in the marble mines. From Ethiopia it is a straight line route to Sri Lanka via
    boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves were likely jewish male - Ethiopian female slaves (i.e. the males were castrated), hence why modern Indians have a similar physiognomy to jews, who then mixed with indigenous Neolithic/Aryans (consentually or by force?). [2]\

Most ancinet history as it is taught today was filterd through the Jesuits. Most Jesuits, including their founder Ignatius Loyola, were marrano/converso jews. Joseph Justus Scalinger alone was credited with "discovering" around 80% of the European history texts that we are taught from today, usually on demand. Most history books from antiquity display Europeans in a negative light, jews as victims, and European triumphs are downplayed. This is probably why. 

*A non-mainstream version of history, but one that is recorded in
    Persian and Islamic sources [3], is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince (Bupares) who was the son of Kai Bahman (Artaxerxes
    II Memnon), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon' [4]
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'. He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta (Alexander is Iksander in Persian and
    "Alakshandra" in Sanskrit and Gupta means 'guardian' or 'protector'
    in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). Evidence of this is
    that the Sanskrit language might be a dialect of Avestan, or a
    Hellenized variant of Avestan, and the similarities of customs and
    religions [5]. Also, there is strong evidence that Alexander's
    successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, ruled India with the
    regional identity of Ashoka the Great [6]. See: Alexander Romance
    [7], The life of Alexander of Macedon [8], and Alexander the
    Great: Beyond the Divide by Charles N. Pope [8].\

2 According to Strabo (II.5.12), by the time of Augustus, up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India: "At any rate, when Gallus was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the Nile as far as Syene and the frontiers of Ethiopia, and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from Myos Hormos to India, whereas formerly, under the Ptolemies, only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise. "— Strabo II.5.12. [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html]
