**The Secular Legacy**

**1 Secularization of Christianity**

As well as Christianity being a slave-morality system, Fredrich Nietzsche wrote that Liberalism is a secularized Christian political-theological religion (16). The Reformation coincided with the invention of the Gutenberg printing press which increased literacy and this is when a myriad of Protestant sects sprung forth: the Anabaptists, the Mennonites, the Amish, the Digger Movement, the Ranters, etc., all of whom adhered to a system of communism and preached about universalism and a utopia on earth. Marxism was one of these sects. The only difference is that Marxism was the first secularized Christian sect where the belief in a supernatural god was replaced with a belief in an omnipresent government. 

**2 Marxism is Secularized Christianity**

_Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat."_ Marx and Engels, ‘Manifesto of the Communist Party’, Selected Works, Volume 1, p 56.
  
If Christianity laid the groundwork for slave morality, Marxism secularized its mechanisms into a political doctrine. Marxism is essentially a secularized Christian sect that replaces god with the government. The central organizing principle of classical Marxist economics, “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”, was lifted verbatim from the pages of the New Testament. Christianity’s universalist ethic; there is no longer Jew or Greek, slave or free” (Galatians 3:28), is mirrored in Marxism’s call for a classless society that transcends national, ethnic, and cultural boundaries. Communal property comes from Acts 4:32-35" "For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need". Marx's historical materialism (theory of history) is the eschatological framework of Christian orthodoxy in secularized form. Christian salvation is Marxian emancipation. The Marxist obsession with labor mirrors Christian veneration of toil (e.g., "by the sweat of your brow"). Marxism glorifies the downtrodden as virtuous, similar to Christianity’s Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12). Also, Marxism is built on the philosophy of liberation and universalism (17) and preys on the impoverished and outcastes of society by promising them a future utopia through the triumph of the proletariat. Marxism, like christianity, is also dogmatic and sectarian; both exalt collectivism over individualism; both justify violence as a catalyst for social change; both prohibit private property; "take from the rich to give to the poor", and "may the last be first", etc. If you strip away the Marxian narrative you will see that at its core it is the exact same christian divide-and-conquer population control system that is designed to weaponize the resentment of the lower classes for the overthrow of society. This is not a coincidence. Influenced by his teacher Bruno Bauer who wrote extensively about how Leftism was a secular christian cult, Karl Marx approached a Christian communist group called the 'League of the Just' (18) and got them to finance him while he came up with an atheist-compatible sect of christianity.  

**3 Marxist Denominations and the Frankfurt School**

  

Marxism is a secularized sect of Christianity that sees class as the main cause for inequality. Critical Theory is a Marxist sect that replaces class with culture as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Cultural Marxism"). Critical Race Theory is a Marxist sect that replaces class with race as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Race Marxism"), and Third Wave Feminism is a Marxist sect that replaces class with gender as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Gender Marxism"). There is overlap between these Marxist sects, and this is called "intersectionality" in academia. For example, feminists teach that class, culture, race and gender all combined (usually encapsulated through "White") are the structural causes of inequality. Marxism’s splintering into sects (e.g., Leninism, Maoism) mirrors Christianity’s denominational schisms.\
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       The Frankfurt School in Germany were Christian heretics. They took Marx's secularized Christianity and created various sects of it (culture, race, gender, "white"). Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno’s "Dialectic of Enlightenment" secularized Christian guilt into cultural critique. Herbert Marcuse’s "Repressive Tolerance" mirrors Christian martyrdom as he taught that oppressors must tolerate their own destruction. Marcuse argues that true tolerance in an oppressive society requires intolerance toward prevailing policies, attitudes, opinions” of the dominant class, while giving preferential treatment to marginalized voices. These jews became the figureheads behind the 'New Left' social movement in the 1960's. This is when the lefts focus on individual liberty and economics was replaced with identity politics and social justice (cultural marxism). But the conditions that allowed for this movement to grow were already present in the culture with roots in christianity, they just secularized it.

**4 Modern Manifestations: Wokeness as Christian Heirloom**

  

Marxism, Critical Theory, Critical Race Theory, Leftism/Wokeism all incorporate the same ethics, metaphors, symbols and meanings that originate in Christianty.

  

*   White guilt/privilege/fragility/et.al. = Christian Original Sin.
*   Monotheism = the binary opposition between good and evil (left vs. right). A singular truth in Christianity (one God, one truth) mirrors the left's ideological stance where there's often a clear delineation of right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, progressive vs. regressive. The moral superiority that white leftists often claim is rooted in this dualistic worldview.
*   White saviorism = Messianism: The idea of white people as moral saviors or messianic figures echoes religious concepts of a redeemer or savior. Many white leftists see themselves as engaging in a divine mission to eradicate racism or save or redeem non-white people.
*   Social activism = Christian mission. The cultural exportation of "Western values" where "whiteness" is the new gospel.
*   Virtue signaling = Christian penance.
*   Publicly exhibiting self-hate/self-flagellating = christian piety signaling. In christianity, genuflection, self-abasement, and self-abnegation are necessary prerequisites for spiritual purity and cleansing. This is expressed as "mortification of the flesh". For 2000 years, Europeans have been rewarded for piety signaling, i.e., displaying self-hate, confession, self-flagellation, etc., and punished for not displaying these things. This is also a form of narcissistic self-sacrifice that is inspired by a suffering servant deity.
*   Salvation/atonement (through accepting jesus and admitting sin) = accepting Leftism and admitting privilege.
*   "Whiteness" = Christian Universalism ("Christendom"). The idea that self-identifying as "white" makes one a representative, spokesperson, or judge of the behavior of the entire group aligns with universalist ideologies where a single entity or belief system is seen as encompassing all humanity. "White" is downstream from the universalist christian identity of "christendom".
*   Race/IQ/gender/genetics denialism ("Boasian anthropology") = "all equal in Jesus".
*   Moralization of Weakness = Leftism, like Christianity, frames weakness or marginalization as inherently virtuous, granting moral authority to the “oppressed” over the “privileged.”. This inverts natural hierarchies, empowering the resentful to dominate through guilt rather than strength.
*   Sanctification of the Marginalized as Sacred: Leftism elevates marginalized groups (e.g., racial minorities, LGBTQ+) to a quasi-sacred status, akin to Christianity’s veneration of the “poor in spirit” or “meek.”. This creates a moral hierarchy where the “oppressed” wield authority over the “privileged,” inverting natural power dynamics.
*   Collective Guilt as Control = Concepts like “white guilt” or “colonial guilt” replicate Christian original sin, imposing collective responsibility on entire groups to enforce compliance.
*   Political Correctness = Heresy.
*   Cancel culture = witch-hunts/excommunicated for heresy.
*   Adopting labels and slogans (pronouns, BLM, trans ally, etc.) = bearing the mark, or taking up the cross. This is equivalent to wearing a cross or crucifix as a visible sign of one's faith and signaling to others that they are a member of the community. They gain social capital in progressive circles through this. 
*   Government = God. An omnipresent entitlement and benefactor giver.

**5 Judaism Vs. Christianity: What do the Jews Believe?**

  

Around the same time that jews at the Alexandrian School in Egypt created the New Testament to mentally subvert their enemies, they plagiarized Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) (where the story of Abraham comes from), Plato's The Laws (347 BC) (19), Manetho’s Aegyptiaca (ca. 285–280 BC) (where the story of Exodus comes from), and Berossus’s Babyloniaca (278 BC) and then turned this new religion into a group strategy that created an intense ethnocentrism, an unconquerable will to power, and a drive to exist at all costs (20).  
  

You can prove that Christianity is a slave morality system that is designed to subvert a group simply by comparing the differences between the Old and New Testaments (21)  
  

*   Jews: "eye for an eye" and "never forgive, never forget". Christians: "turn the other cheek" and "submit to the evil doer".
*   Jews: "life should be endowed with material worth." Jews do not believe in an afterlife and believe in achieving riches and pleasure in this life. Christians believe in asceticism and that they will be rewarded in the afterlife.
*   Jews: the Torah contains over 100 mitzvot concerning business and money-making. Christians: "usury" and money lending is one of the worst sins.
*   Jews: master race/"God's chosen people", outbreeding or conversion is forbidden. Christians: Universalist/"all are one in Jesus", "love thy brother". Having "pride" is one of the worst sins.
*   Jews: multiple mitzvots that command them to be fruitful and have as many kids as possible. Christians: the bible preaches celibacy \[too many verses to quote, so go here: link\], antinatalism (Ecclesiastes 4:3, Job 3:16, Matthew 26:24), sex is a sin and virginity is exhaulted, and moreover, "jesus" even says that men should castrate themselves to gain entry into the kingdom of heaven! (Matthew 19:11-12 \[link\])
*   The “New Testament” was built on Judaism, which unconsciously ties Christians to Jewish masters.
*   Judaism is tribal. Christianity is universal.
*   Judaism is an ethnocentric religion that does not accept converts. Christians actively seek converts of all races because Christian Universalism considers everyone equal.
*   The Old Testament is filled with hatred, violence, killing, and war. The New Testament is filled with love, unconditional tolerance, and anti-rebellion: "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword".
*   Jews loath Christians, but Christians believe that Jews are "God's chosen" and they exist to serve Israel.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, it took 1000 years of domestication to reach the point where Europeans would sacrifice their nations and the future of their children on the altar of equality, but the seeds for this was inculcated through this system. 1000 years of being born into, an raised in, a domestication system created a domestication human who champions their own extintion just so long as it makes them feel morally and socially superior to the other half. This relict of monotheism and the concept of sin. This is Nietzsche called the "Last Man"; .the domesticated European slaves of today. He is 'tolerant,' but this is less a principle than a need to feel uniquely ethical compared to the other half of his tribe he judges as bigoted. He feels guilty for his ancestors' achievements, a guilt that ironically confirms his own social sophistication. He believes in nothing except his own comfort and the dogmas of universal equality handed down to him, because adhering to them unquestioningly grants him a sense of being on the right side of history. He is a hollowed-out shell, incapable of producing the culture, art, or heroes of his forebears because the very wellspring of that vitality—the will to power, the loyalty to kin, the pride in self—has been systematically poisoned for generations. He doesn't defend his borders because "all are one in Christ." He doesn't have children because the world is a "vale of tears" and his body is a source of sin. He surrenders his sovereignty to globalist entities because he yearns for the universal peace of the Second Coming, now in the secular form of a world government. \
   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoning Christianity doesn’t save anyone from its psychological wreckage—it just strips away the rituals while leaving the rot untouched. The guilt, the martyr complex, the need to be seen as "good" by some higher power—those don’t die when God does. They sink deeper. The ex-Christian leftist atheist still flinches at judgment, still needs to be told they’re righteous, still sees sacrifice as virtue. They just shift the stage. Instead of churches, it’s activism. Instead of priests, it’s influencers, scientists, political leaders. The same wiring remains: obey, repent, be validated. The names change, the neurosis doesn't. It's not just belief that traps them—it’s the need for submission, the craving for punishment, the addiction to external meaning. Without confronting that, they'll keep dressing up their servitude as enlightenment. It's not liberation. It’s just a new leash.

**Addendum**

My critique of leftism was not coming from a conservative perspective. Leftism is a secularized variant of protestantism (puritanism), but conservatism is secularized catholicism with its focus on hierarcy and tradtion. Western left vs. right politics is a relict of abrahamic monotheism.

6\. Marcion of Sinope was a theologian who rejected the Hebrew Bible and the God of the Old Testament. The Marcionites taught that the Jews really were "the synagogue of Satan". He denied that Jesus had been a Jew, and saw that it was preposterous to claim that an incarnate god could die or would foolishly have himself crucified. Marcion of Sinope = Markianos of Alexandria, a jewish student of Rabbi Akiva. This was a cleaver ruse to repulse the jews from adopting the psy-op. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: "Was it not a necessary feature of a truly brilliant politics of vengeance, a far-sighted, subterranean, slowly and carefully planned vengeance, that Israel had to deny its true instrument publicly and nail him to the cross like a mortal enemy, so that the whole world might naively swallow the bait?".  Ie. Nietzsche saw that successful promotion of Christianity depended on a pretence of reciprocal hostility between Christians and Jews. Adding anti-semitic passages to the bible could also be seen as a way to seperate the jewishness from it. Karl Marx published 'On the Jewish Question' immediately before the 'The Communist Manifesto' presumably for the same purpose. \
--Christianity has other inbuilt mechanisms to prevent jews from converting. Ex. Calling jews the "synagogue of Satan"; Jesus disobeys the strict dietary laws of the Jewish religion by picking ears of corn on the Sabbath when work is forbidden, eats with unwashed hands and with publicans and sinners. "Love thy neighbor" including the despised Samaritans. Also, the main weapon to repulse jews from Christianity was the Talmud, written after the Bible had been compiled in which the Rabbis preached hatred against Christians.
