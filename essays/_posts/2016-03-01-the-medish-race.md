**Introduction**
  
Once upon a time the greater part of the Caucasian world of Europe, North Africa and West Asia was populated by these brachy- to dolichocephalic people of intermediate pigmentation, and the spark of civilization was ignited in the region, where a series of pre-historic cultures and glorious empires flourished: Göbekli Tepe, Megalithic, Celtic, Mesopotamian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Indus Valley, Egyptian, Nubian, Ethiopian, Persian, Anatolian and Phoenician, just to name a few. Alas, since then the inferior races, drawn to these vibrant centers of activity like moths to a flame, have displaced or absorbed much of this great and noble race, reducing what's left of it to the middle regions of the Caucasian world, whence it gets its name.

**The Medish Race**
    
Medish peoples are descended primarily from Neolithic agriculturalists. Neolithic people originated in the Caucuses region and moved into Europe and south into the Middle East and North Africa in successive waves roughly from 12,000 to 6,400 years ago. They became the Early Anatolian Farmers (EAF) who became the Iranian Hunter-Gatherers/Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG)/West Anatolians who became proto-Sardinian peoples (Early European Farmers (EEF)) and East Anatolians migrated further east and went extinct as a minority among unrelated groups who became Iranians, however, a segment of them moved onto India and became the Harappan civilization. All of the ancient Middle Eastern, North African, and Indus Valley civilizations were founded by these Neolithic people. 

The so-called Nordics (Indo-Aryans) were in fact originally brunet -- and medium-skinned, brunet dolichocephals = Medish peoples. They belonged to an old Paleo-Centrid stratum of intermediate evolutionary development, which also includes other periphery types in the area as well as in Asia Minor (the only Medish land bordering Sudish territory). It wasn't until the absorption of blond East Baltic elements in Northern Europe that these unfortunate supermen became Nordic and disappeared forever into the Nordish race.    
  
**Inferior Races**
  
**NORDISH**  
  
Subdivided into Nordids, Borrebids, Baltids and Uralids. Characterized by pig faces and pink pig skin; yellow, orange or white hair; and significant assimilation of mongolid elements. 

They are borealized and depigmented neolithics who were subjected to hyper-domestication syndrome \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_syndrome)\] \[[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/#!po=8.25243)\] and human self-domestication \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-domestication)\].

Traits of domestication syndrome:

Behavioral:

*   Low in-group preference or sense of tribalism ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635723000888))
*   As part of the system of self-domestication animals begin self-policing group members to enforce the norms of the group and deter other members from behaving in ways that could disrupt the social order. Ex. dogs are often seen growling at or barking at other dogs who they see as behaving inappropriately.
*   No sense of self-agency, independence, and follows orders (once domesticated, being part of the herd becomes more important than being right) ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40656-020-00315-0))
*   Less threat reactivity
*   Poor maternal instincts ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5857534/))

Phenotype:

*   Neoteny ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096361/)) ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/)) ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Neoteny)) and feminization ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Feminization)) in males
*   Brachycephaly (short and round skulls which leads to a reduction of the back of the brain and a smaller amygdala (1))
*   Weak jaws
*   Low muscle mass in males
*   Poor eyesight ([ref](https://books.google.ca/books?id=hEy4AAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y))
*   Incompletely developed neural crest which leads to craniofacial abnormalities, neurological problems, lower intelligence, and vision problems ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8633094/)) ([ref](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140714100122.htm/))
*   Notice how the entirety of the nordic races have the pig phenotype? \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/Borreby.html)\] (including pink skin tone \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebald)\]). This is the same species-specific domestication process that turned a wolf into a dog \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeSGC_O5_OZYOjFaf9X2b3IGFI2pMPPPILGE2rzzUWfYxgxFatcP81ZTa6BPMn4xLUPjASDJX41whJGBZgGuMefddh-OXbKLzeChjUF2K4uQaVMMEI1A__HSnsL1LfRbxFQm2RdSt-4RLcGAXqokw5E54pW4i8OXTsScuMdgeSLkDAVtuiwpOxXMyWl9E/s1500/wolfvsdog.jpg)\] and a wild boar into a domesticated pig \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT_wCGxsxJY-7-NPKEliqxVFLud2sWiXE_wFQr7tS1G3-hqk2kmZzoy1UaKbN8kq8RCrFb6SygHVRWNGMjCC93zNc7w1nYX0oQypFf-sEenu_XjIE-GVHUU7uLXydpcjQKdilC2zmowNn4yGvsO8MqAwYyjdQgUpem4CjnFFaF7D_47oI42wyzaagTRnI/s1536/wild-boar-vs-pig-collage.jpg)\]
  

**SUDISH**  
  
Subdivided into Semitids, Hamitids, Armenids and Indids. Characterized by sunburnt skin; black, often frizzy, hair; black eyes; and significant assimilation of negrid elements. Representative types:

While Medish people are concentrated in Central/Southern Europe, remnants of ancient Medish populations can be found in pockets and as individuals throughout the Nordish and Sudish worlds (see next section on Medish Distribution). Here are some examples of pure Medish types native to non-Medish areas**:**

**Note that Medish people have also found their way to modern multicultural countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, primarily through immigration from Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Balkans, the Ukraine and Celtic Britain. Though they're a minority element in all of these nations as a whole, they make up between 25% and 75% of the population in specific regions such as Quebec, Louisiana and  the Northeastern U.S. They're also very common in big cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto, Sydney etc.**  
  
  
**Medish Aesthetics** 
  
The balance that characterizes The Medish Race's position within humanity is nowhere more evident than in the realm of racial aesthetics. The subtypes that make up the Nordish and Sudish races are basically mutations of ideal Medish types**:** Nordids are lanky Mediterranids suffering from albinism; Borrebids, Baltids and Uralids are, respectively, elephantized, albinized and mongolized Alpinids; Semitids, Hamitids and Indids are sunburned, negrified Mediterranids; and Armenids are hyper-brachycephalic, hook-nosed Dinarids -- all aberrant forms, with the original Medish types representing the norm.  
  
Yet despite this tangible reality, and the many examples of attractive Medish types already seen here, a lot of people still buy into the old adage that beauty is in the eye of beholder. This is not, however, the opinion held by the scientific community, which has done extensive research on objective standards of attractiveness in humans, arriving at the inevitable conclusion. The following studies provide irrefutable evidence of Medish aesthetic superiority**:**

> > By calculating prototypic very attractive vs. unattractive faces for each gender, we were able to show that these faces are remarkably different in their attributes, such as skin texture, proportions etc. Additional **surveys showed that** **attractive** **female faces are narrower than unattractive ones, and that they possess a brown skin and full, well looked-after lips**. The distance between the eyes is larger, eyelids are thinner, there are more, longer and darker eyelashes, darker and narrower eyebrows, higher cheekbones, and the nose is narrower than in less attractive female faces. Surprisingly, more or less **the same is the case for attractive male faces: they, too, have a browner skin, a narrower face, fuller lips, thinner eyelids, more and darker eyelashes, darker eyebrows, and higher cheekbones than the less attractive ones**. Attractive male faces can furthermore be characterized by a more prominent lower jaw and chin.

> > 
> > ABSTRACT**:** Investigated stereotypes associated with hair color. 79 male and 161 female undergraduates completed semantic differential scales on 7 categories of hair-color person. **Dark men clearly preferred brunette women; blond men were equally divided in preference for blondes and brunettes; blond, brunette, and red-headed women clearly preferred dark men; and artificial blondes preferred dark and blonde men**. Other comparisons were made within sex and between hair-color groups. Results indicate: (a) stereotypes based on hair color are widely held, (b) different stereotypes exist on the basis of the hair color and sex of the respondent, and (c) 4 of the 6 hair-color categories gave the highest scores to their own group.  

  
It's no surprise that almost all women prefer Medish men (the proverbial "tall, dark and handsome" type), but note that the greater part of men -- including Nordish men -- also exhibit a preference for Medish traits in women. This flies in the face of Nordish society's delusional stereotype of the blue-eyed blonde as a physical ideal that all men lust after.

**Medish Achievement**
  
Almost all of the world's cultural achievements are the product of The Medish Race. And the only non-Medish people to have contributed to civilization are those who have received direct or indirect influence from Medish culture. As previously noted, all pre-historic European and ancient Mediterranean cultures (including Greece and Rome) were Medish in origin, as were Renaissance cultures in Northern Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Austria. Together, these formed the basis and bulk of what we know today as Western Civilization.  
  
This great civilization is responsible for most of the world's knowledge, and has yielded an excess of geniuses. Aristotle (fig. 1, below) possessed the sharpest mind the world has ever seen, past or present, writing on a number of subjects from poetry to astronomy. He was Medish of the Mediterranid sub-variety. Leonardo DaVinci (fig. 2) was arguably the most intelligent artist, thinker and inventor in history and the very definition of a Renaissance Man. He was also Medish, and of the Dinarid sub-variety. Ludwig van Beethoven (fig. 3) is renowned as the greatest composer who ever lived, completing nine symphonies despite going deaf. Naturally, he belonged to The Medish Race as well, representing the Alpinid sub-variety.

**MEDISH GIANTS: _Fig. 1_: Aristotle (Mediterranid); _Fig. 2_: Leonardo Da Vinci (Dinarid); _Fig. 3_:** **Ludwig van Beethoven (Alpinid)**  

  
Other geniuses of The Medish Race include thinkers and scientists like [Socrates](socrates.jpg), [Archimedes](archimedes.gif), [Galileo](galileo.jpg), Renée [Descartes](descartes.jpg), Blaise [Pascal](pascal.jpg), Nicolas [Copernicus](copernicus.gif), Johannes [Kepler](kepler.gif), Gregor [Mendel](mendel.jpg), Carl [Jung](jung.jpg), Enrico [Fermi](fermi.jpg) and Nikola [Tesla](tesla.jpg); composers like Johann Sebastian [Bach](bach.gif), Antonio [Vivaldi](vivaldi.jpg), Johannes [Brahms](brahms.gif), Wolfgang Amadeus [Mozart](mozart.jpg), Gioacchino [Rossini](rossini.jpg) and Giuseppe [Verdi](verdi.jpg); great authors like [Homer](homer.jpg), [Vergil](vergil.jpg), Miguel de [Cervantes](cervantes.jpg), [Dante](dante.jpg) Alighieri, William [Shakespeare](shakespeare.jpg), Wolfgang von [Goethe](goethe.jpg), [Voltaire](voltaire.gif), Charles [Dickens](dickens.jpg), Leo [Tolstoy](tolstoy.jpg), Fyodor [Dostoevsky](dostoevsky.gif) and Nikos [Kazantzakis](kazantzakis.jpg); artists such as [Michelangelo](michelangelo.jpg) Buonarroti, [Raffaello](raffaello.jpg) Sanzio, Jacopo [Tintoretto](tintoretto.jpg), Sandro [Botticelli](botticelli.jpg), Jacques-Louis [David](david.jpg), Eugene [Delacroix](delacroix.gif), [El Greco](elgreco.jpg) and Diego [Velazquez](velazquez.jpg); and filmmakers like Federico [Fellini](fellini.jpg), Luchino [Visconti](visconti.jpg), Jean [Renoir](renoir.jpg), Vittorio [de Sica](desica.gif), Werner [Herzog](herzog.jpg), Jean [Cocteau](cocteau.jpg), Martin [Scorsese](scorsese.jpg) and Francis Ford [Coppola](coppola.jpg). Most famed explorers were Medish, including Ferdinand [Magellan](magellan.jpg), Hernan [Cortez](cortez.jpg), Francisco [Pizarro](pizarro.gif), Jacques [Cartier](cartier.jpg), Christopher [Columbus](columbus.jpg), who discovered the New World, and Amerigo [Vespucci](vespucci.jpg), after whom America was named. Military prowess is also Medish territory, with such towering figures as [Alexander](alexander.jpg) the Great, Julius [Caesar](caesar.jpg), [Napoleon](napoleon.gif) Bonaparte, [Vlad](vlad.gif) the Impaler and Adolf [Hitler](hitler.jpg) [\[2\]](#2). Contemporary Italian and German automakers like Enzo [Ferrari](ferrari.jpg), Ferruccio [Lamborghini](lamborghini.jpg), Ferdinand [Porsche](porsche.jpg) and Gottlieb [Daimler](daimler.jpg) are all Medish, as are the [Three Tenors](tenors.jpg) and Andrea [Bocelli](bocelli.jpg). Mustafa Kemal [Ataturk](ataturk.jpg), whose bold social reforms are the sole reason Turkey isn't a horrid Muslim dictatorship like the rest of the Near East, was, needless to say, also Medish. And, contrary to Nordicist belief, the ancient Teutonic nobility belonged to The Medish Race as well [\[3\]](#3). The list of great figures is endless, going back to the dawn of civilization and spanning every field of knowledge and achievement. There's almost no one noteworthy who doesn't belong at least partially to The Medish Race. In fact, it would be much easier to name the famous people who _aren't_ Medish**:** Confucius, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Dolph Lundgren. That's about it.  
  
The map below indicates cities that were centers of artistic and humanistic achievement during the Renaissance. All of the activity is concentrated in the Medish part of Europe and a few adjacent areas (see next section for info on British achievement). The purely Nordish areas of Scandinavia and the East Baltic, and the Sudish areas of North Africa and the Ottoman Empire, are totally inactive, with the exception of one city in occupied (and Medish) Greece.

Even something as seemingly trivial as the culinary arts are dominated by Medish types. Nordish people eat boiled sheep guts and deep-fried candy bars. Sudish people have some good dishes but eat them with their fingers and flies swarming around. Far Eastern people are skilled in the culinary arts, but their degenerate fetishes for shark fins and bull testicles, combined with an aversion to all things creamy, keep them out of the pantheon. Only Medish people have achieved the perfect marriage of ingredients and presentation, and their diet is considered the healthiest in the world to boot [\[4\]](#4). When we think of gourmet cuisine, French, Italian, Spanish and Greek immediately spring to mind. And when speaking of great chefs, the figures at the forefront are Jacques [Pépin](pepin.jpg), Mario [Batali](batali.jpg), Paul [Prudhomme](prudhomme.jpg), Jacques [Torres](torres.jpg), Emeril [Lagasse](lagasse.jpg) and Wolfgang [Puck](puck.jpg) -- all pure representatives of The Medish Race.    
  
**Medish Decline**
  
Just as everything great in the world is of Medish origin, so is everything bad of Nordish and Sudish origin. Having already alluded to the ruined state of formerly Medish areas in the Caucasian world, we now turn our attention to the threats posed to the Medish core in Central/Southern Europe. It was the coming of Nordish barbarians -- Goths, Lombards, Vandals [\[5\]](#5), Franks, Vikings, Normans, Huns and Avars -- that destroyed the great Medish civilization of Rome. They reduced it to rubble and rearranged the pieces according to their savage ways, plunging Europe into a Dark Age of feudalism and superstition. Evidence of the immorality and barbarity of these Nordish invaders can be found in the following account of Viking daily life by Ibn Fadhlan**:**  
  

> > ...the dirtiest creatures of God. They have no shame in voiding their bowels and bladder, nor do they wash themselves when polluted by emissions of semen, nor do they wash their hands after eating. They are, then, like asses who have gone astray. ... They may have intercourse with their maiden while their comrades look on. At times, a crowd of them come together to do such things [\[6\]](#6). ... As a matter of duty, they wash daily their faces and heads in a manner so dirty and so unclean as could possibly be imagined.  

  
Fortunately, the Medish people absorbed only a small amount of Nordish barbarian blood and maintained a connection to their past glories through all the turmoil. Thus, they were able to regroup from their setback to produce the Renaissance in Northern Italy, which, as we've seen, would quickly spread throughout the Medish world. However, some areas have yet to fully recover from the devastating Nordish invasions, like Southern Italy for example. The article _[Looking to 2007: Italy Times Two](http://www.csis.org/europe/pubs/Italy2007.pdf)_ (1999) by Stanton H. Burnett and Stefano Vaccara addresses this issue**:**  
  

> > Robert Putnam sees the profound difference in civil society within Italy as stemming from the Middle Ages, especially the Norman-Swabian centralized rule in the South, as compared to the history of civic consciousness experienced by the North and Center during the era of the great bourgeois city communes.  

  
The barbarians also reached Britain, displacing the native Medish Celts [\[7\]](#7) and nearly drowning the island in Nordish blood. But luckily, Britain had been part of the Roman Empire -- the only Northern land to enjoy this distinction -- and that influence, along with the remaining unadulterated Medish blood, was able to sustain continued culture there [\[8\]](#8). Roman law and architecture, coupled with the drama, poetry, astronomy, democracy etc. of Medish Greeks, led to a flourishing of culture that carried over to America, running for a surprisingly long time on the fumes of the Medish machine, so to speak. But other Nordish areas were not so lucky and remained backward for centuries. It's well documented that Scandinavian lands were like the Third World until very recently, saved only by their discovery of Marxism**:**

Yet despite their advances in living standards, these nations have been consistently unable to make any significant cultural advances, their main claim to fame being ugly, minimalist furniture that perfectly embodies their cold, mongolian efficiency. But it's precisely degenerate trash like this that passes for "culture" in the modern West, its infiltration constituting a sort of new "Nordish invasion". The image on the left shows what the unmixed Nordish race thinks a chair should look like. Compare it to the grand, ornate Medish chair of days gone by that's depicted on the right**:**

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Today, Western Civilization has slipped completely out of the grip of the North's Medish minority and Greco-Roman influence, and fallen into the hands of the Nordish masses. And what they're doing to it is nothing short of disastrous. All of their actions are either specifically geared toward, or have the unintended effect of, annihilating Classical traditions. Over the past century they've given us neo-Marxism, welfare states, single-parent families, women's lib, gay civil unions and gay adoption, multi-culturalism, illegal immigration, racial quotas, degenerate modern art, global warming, junk food, reality TV, and "celebrities" like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton. Clearly, the West is going down the toilet, and it's the Nordish race that's doing the flushing.  
  
  
The main source of Medish decline in the late Middle Ages, which has lasted up to the present, was the Sudish Muslim occupations. These affected all Medish zones -- Spain, Portugal, Southern France, Southern Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Austria and Hungary -- with Hamito-Semitid Arabs and Berbers (Moors), as well as Armenid Turks, attempting to convert Christian Europe to the filthy Sudish "religion" of Islam [\[9\]](#9). But gallant Medish warriors banded together and drove out the heathen barbarians. Some of the affected lands have recovered, others are still recovering, and still others -- like Albania, Bulgaria and parts of the former Yugoslavia -- have yet to completely shake off the foreign religion. However, as bad as these after effects are, the Medish core of Europe was thankfully not affected by the invasions in a racial sense, as the following autosomal DNA study indicates clearly**:**

> > The most evident feature of the gene frequency patterns described in this study is **the presence across the Mediterranean of a longitudinal line of sharp genetic change**. This line, supported by analyses based on 2 different measures of genetic distance, runs from Gibraltar to Lebanon; it includes all 5 sharpest of the boundaries identified on the basis of Prevosti's distances (Figure 2) and 4 of the 5 sharpest boundaries identified using Nei's distances (Figure 3).

Of course, modern immigration from the Muslim world to countries like France, Germany, Spain and Italy could very well break right through this genetic barrier as well as reintroduce Islam into Europe. It's the new "Sudish invasion" and it has to be stopped before it reaches uncontrollable levels.  
  
  
Finally, making recovery even more difficult in the Medish areas of Eastern Europe is the long presence there of communism, which was implemented by half-Mongol Russian Vladimir [Lenin](lenin.gif) and Georgian darkie Joseph [Stalin](stalin.jpg). Only a defective Nordish mind working together with depraved Sudish villainy could produce such unfathomable hell on earth as witnessed during the Soviet era. Fortunately, communism has fallen and the Medish people once held down by it are slowly but surely catching up with the rest of Europe.  
  
  
**Medish Preservation**
  
The only upside to this dreadful turn of events is that the Nordish race won't be around much longer to mess things up. The aforementioned rampant immigration and multi-racialism Nordish people endorse will soon result in their burial under a sea of African, Asian, East Indian, Muslim, Mexican and Puerto Rican elements [\[10\]](#10). When this happens, Medish people will finally be able to reclaim Western Civilization from the sewer and begin measures to repair it and carry it into the future. Already, the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th largest economies in Europe belong respectively to Germany (thanks to its Medish majority), France, Italy and Spain, according to the latest World Factbook figures. And the cultural traditions of these countries, while currently eclipsed by crass Americanism, still enjoy worldwide acclaim as paragons of refinement and sophistication. This is why it's so important to protect Medish populations from Nordish values and the Sudish infiltration these are encouraging. The Medish Race has a destiny, and that destiny must be fulfilled at any cost.

[\[2\]](#2b)  Note that Hitler and other Nazis, although military geniuses, were mentally disturbed individuals corrupted by envy and hysteria originating in the Nordish part of the Germanic world. The Third Reich was essentially run by Medish people, which explains why it was so efficient. However, they all suffered from an identity crisis that led them to advance a blond-centered Nordicist ideology. This is why their empire ultimately failed, resulting in so much senseless killing and destruction.

He notes the same in Germany among the old nobility. '...the true type of the primeval Teuton,' have dark or black hair." (Frank H. Hankins, [_The Racial Basis of Civilization: A Critique of the Nordic Doctrine_](http://dienekes.ifreepages.com/blog/archives/000157.html), 1931)

[\[5\]](#5b)  The word _vandalism_ comes from this particularly savage tribe which did nothing but pilfer, plunder and desecrate areas of high culture.  

  
[\[6\]](#6b)  We can see this sexual depravity carried into the modern world, with an abundance of pornographic websites featuring blond Nordish women allowing themselves to be gangbanged by groups of Negroes. Do a search for "blacks on blondes" and you'll see just how widespread this phenomenon is. Of course, Medish women would never dream of engaging in such behavior, especially for the whole world to see.

([_Genes Link Celts to Basques_](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1256894.stm), _BBC News_, 2001). Note also that much of what's considered "English" culture actually has its roots among these Celts, such as the Arthurian legend, which is based on ancient Celtic tales appropriated by Nordish Anglo-Saxons.  
  
[\[8\]](#8b)  A recent article in _British Archaeology_ entitled _[Roman Britons After 410](http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba68/feat1.shtml)_ confirms the impact of the Roman occupation on the development of British culture**:** "The 'end of Roman Britain' is a myth. ... The Roman cultural legacy survived far more profoundly, more extensively and for much longer in Britain than is usually realised." The following passage shows how Medish people resisted Nordish bombardment**:** "And when the crisis really did come, with the advent of the Vikings a couple of hundred years later, awareness of the Roman past was never stronger."  
  
[\[9\]](#9b)  Note that while the Moorish masses belonged to the Sudish race, the upper-class Moors who developed algebra and medical technology were remnants of an ancient Medish nobility, as can be seen from their depictions in [illuminated manuscripts](moors.jpg) of the 13th century. A similar situation existed among the Turks.

And the situation in the United States is the same, if not worse.
