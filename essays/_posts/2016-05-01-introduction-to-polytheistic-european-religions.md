1 Quick introduction to Polytheistic Ethnic European ('Pagan') Religions

"Pagan" (Latin: pāgānus, 'rural') was supposed to be a slur that was invented by the catholic church to apply to every non-xtian religion but has since been reappropriated as a general term. Specific ethnic "Pagan" polytheistic religions are: Heathenry is Germanic Paganism ("Asatru" is one of the religions that fall under the Heathenry category). Fyrnsidu is Brittonic Paganism. Druidry is Celtic Paganism. Hellenism is Greek Paganism. Religio Romana is Roman Paganism. Rodnovery is Slavic Paganism. Romuva is Baltic Paganism, etc. Every polytheistic ancestral European religion is similar, the deities just have different regional names (1).

There are only two things that you need to know to understand Polytheistic Ethnic European Religions

1.1 Cosmology

The cosmology of the ancient polytheistic European religions is Dharmic (non-dogmatic). You could be a polytheist, pantheist, atheist (2) and still find value in tradition, rituals, and ancestor veneration. Some polytheistic religious followers see the polytheistic deities as sentient personal gods, others see them as symbolic representations of natural forces or abstract concepts (numen/animism) (3) and the cosmology is pantheism to them, others are atheists (4) who are attracted to tradition, ancestor veneration, and ancestry. Some atheistic Pagans are inspired by Carl Jung who combined psychoanalysis with Heathenry; the polytheistic deities = 'archetypes (5) of the collective unconscious (6)' to these Pagans.

1.2 Rituals

Rituals are about manifesting the deities/forces of nature/laws of physics into your daily life. In the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries (7), the rituals were believed to provide initiates with profound insights into the nature of reality, the cycle of life and death, and the interconnectedness of all things. They also served important social functions, such as reinforcing community bonds, resolving conflicts, and marking life transitions (see: the Olympic Games and the festival of Dionysus). To secular Pagans who are inspired by Carl Jung, rituals are ways of manifesting the Jungian archetypes into your life, inducing 'active imagination' (8), or a part of the process of 'individuation' (9)

2 Druidism

Christianity is a subversion of Celtic Druidism, filtered through an imperial cult where Asander of Bosphorus aka Julius Caesar took on the Esus \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esus)\] role. The Galatians of Anatolia were Celtics who followed Druidism and this religion was subverted by jews after the Bar Kohiba revolt. See: On the Origins of Christianity \[[link](https://christcuck.org/on-the-origins-of-christianity)\]. So, christians coming to Paganism, specifically Celtic Druidism, can continue worshiping Esus/Esos/Hesus/Aisus/Iesus and all the other Druidic traditions and rituals that christianity stole. Converting christians to Druidism (10) should be easy as it is the foundation for their religion with the same deity, traditions, and rituals (11), but without the old testament and proto-bolshevism slave-morality.

1\. Dyaus Pita (Vedic), Zeus (Greek), Jupiter (Roman), Odin (Nordic), Wotan (German), Esus (Celtic), Wotanaz (Slavic), Ukko and Väinämöinen (Finnish), and so on are all derived from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of Dyeus, and Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter'. Wotan is derived from Proto-Germanic Wodanaz, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European root Dyeus. Odin comes from Old Norse and is related to the earlier Proto-Germanic Wodanaz.\

3\. These Pagans don't worship a particular thing, they just appreciate the unity of existence, or seek to understand the ultimate nature of reality. Ancestor veneration is the only worship they do.\

10\. Diodorus writes that the Druids were "philosophers" and "learned men" who were honored. Strabo mentions that their domain was both natural philosophy and moral philosophy.\
--Pythagoras learned from a philosopher named Abaris the Hyperborean \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaris_the_Hyperborean)\] who was a Scythian who hailed from Hyperborea. The Irish annals talk about a Druid named Abhras visiting Greece. The name "Abaris" and the Greek word "αβαρίς" (abarís), which is a variant of the word "απαρίς" (aparís), meaning "from the far north" or "Hyperborean". This word is also related to the Greek word "απαρτίζω" (apartizō), which means "to purify" or "to cleanse", similar to the first part of Pythagoras' name. So, was Pythagoras also Abaris the Hyperborean? Very likely. The Druids were a Pythagoras cult: "And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this discipline. Now after the death of Pythagoras, Zamolxis, repairing thither, became to them the originator of this philosophy" -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus\
11\. Winter Solstice Celebrations: Christmas, celebrated on December 25, coincides with the ancient pagan festival of Yule, which marked the winter solstice. Druids would light fires and decorate trees to symbolize the return of the sun. Easter and the Spring Equinox: Easter, falls around the spring equinox. Druids celebrated the festival of Ostara, which honored the goddess Eostre, often depicted with eggs and rabbits. These symbols have been co-opted by Christianity, with eggs representing new life and rabbits symbolizing fertility. The Celebration of the Summer Solstice: Druids would celebrate the summer solstice with bonfires and rituals to honor the sun. Christianity's celebration of St. John's Day (June 24) coincides with the summer solstice, and some traditions involve lighting bonfires. The Celebration of the Autumn Equinox: Druids would celebrate the autumn equinox with rituals to honor the harvest. Christianity's celebration of the Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6) coincides with the autumn equinox in some parts of the world.
