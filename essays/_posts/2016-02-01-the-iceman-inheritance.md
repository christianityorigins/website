Author Michael Anderson Bradley wrote two books: _The Iceman Inheritance: Prehistoric Sources of Western Man's Racism, Sexism and Aggression_ (1978) \[[link](https://www.amazon.sg/dp/1879831007)\] and _Chosen People from the Caucasus: Jewish Origins, Delusions, Deceptions and Historical Role in the Slave Trade, Genocide and Cultural Colonization_ (1992) \[[link](https://www.amazon.com/Chosen-People-Caucasus-Deceptions-Historical/dp/0883781476)\] in which he theorizes that the Jews are the remnants of the Neanderthals that were nearly rubbed out by the Cro-Magnons 7500 years ago and they are now nursing a deathless hatred of their enemies who today are all the non-Jews of the world.

Bradley, a Jewish writer, warns us:

“It is time for the non-Semitic peoples of the world to come together in a multi-racial alliance under one banner in order to severely limit Semitic activities before they put an end to us and everything else on the planet. . . . However, I will warn everyone that it may well be too late.”

In two astonishing books, Bradley writes of the Cro-Magnon slaughter of Neanderthals c. 5600 BC. Remnants of the nearly extinct hunchbacks retreated to deep in the impenetrable mountains of the Caucasus, where their vengeful retribution has been felt in every area of human endeavor ever since.

Bradley figures monotheism is a Neanderthal plot to more efficiently control the people who are targeted as the hosts of their parasitic perversities, with the implication that all of human civilization has been influenced by the predispositions of Neanderthal DNA. DNA samples prove that Semitic populations are possessed of up to 70 percent of Neanderthal DNA, which accounts for why what is now the nation of Israel has been the epicenter of world violence since most ancient times, Bradley concludes.

He insists that today’s Jews who are plundering the world on every level of reality and calls for a mlti-racial analysis of this thoroughly perfidious group, which is now busy destroying the world by its control of money and all the governments of the world.

“This is precisely what I argued in The Iceman Inheritance (1978), Chosen People from the Caucasus (1992) and what Erik Trinkaus at least inferred in his The Neanderthals of 1992. However, my own calculations indicate that some Middle East Semitic populations approach 50 percent Neanderthal and in some very specific small areas, 70 percent Neanderthal. Given the usually modest Semitic populations in mountain valleys and arid landscapes of the Caucasus Middle East, this sort of Neanderthal DNA concentration among some groups would not affect that ”1 to 4 percent" of the total world population very much.”

On his website \[[link](https://www.michaelbradley.info)\], Bradley presents an astonishing conclusion:

“In my view, there are two major subspecies of technical humanity presently contending for the domination of our world."

“Their Chosen People pretension is a typical Neanderthal in-group obsession that is actually a genetic racist predisposition against all other humans. It is a genetically determined “us against them” mentality. Their higher level of known Neanderthal aggression against outsiders is responsible for their disproportional social influence wherever they have settled in the West. . . . The Ashkenazi Jews, as a group, exhibit lingering Neanderthal traits most strongly among living Caucasians because of Jewish prohibitions against marriage with outsiders. Their Neanderthal genes have been kept “all in the family”, as it were. These Neanderthal genes were not diluted by intermarriage nearly as much as with most other Caucasians.”

According to Bradley, the Neanderthal heritage of modern-day Jewish people explains much about their ongoing problems with not only the native people of Palestine but with other people on the planet. He writes:

“This unfortunate combination of high aggression combined with a tendency toward emotional instability and hysteria when they feel nervous or threatened . . . which is all the time when they are not? in absolute control. And they are arrogant, but uneasy, even then. An ethnic symptom of this emotional instability is the Jewish tendency toward hypochondria. Even they cannot (yet) control death. This unfortunate combination of high aggression combined with a tendency toward hysteria and emotional instability has proved to be a dangerous and tragic situation over the course of Western history. Their aggression encourages continual Jewish attempts to control societies, while the emotional instability makes it difficult for most Jews to distinguish reasonably between justified social criticism by their non-Jewish neighbors and attacks.”

“Insensitive even to objective concerns about inordinate Jewish influence in societies, and reacting with hysterical aggression to any such supposed “attack” on their behavior and pleas from non-Jews to limit it, Jews have always provoked violence against themselves. And then they, with much emotional satisfaction, feel victimized and attribute the situation to innate “anti-Semitism” among their neighbors.”

In essence, the Barnes Review concluded:

Bradley contends that people and cultures emerging from the Caucasus Mountains (a known refuge of late lingering Neanderthal populations) in proto-historical and historical times would have remained highly intelligent, highly aggressive and psychosexually maladapted (promoting a high level of in-group cohesion). These traits, Bradley contends, explain the survival of Biblical Hebrews against all odds and also the inordinate social influence of modern Western Jews.

Bradley contends that there is no mystique of “the chosen people.” “Monotheism”— a purely male and abstract Godhead— is merely a result of Neanderthal glacial physical and mental adaptations or maladaptations. Proven Neanderthal in-group cohesion and extreme aggression together resulted in a fiercely parochial “chosen people” perspective. The cultural fusion of the two separate streams of “Jews” has, since the 16th century, played an important role in the evolution of Western civilization and thus in the molding of the entire world’s present cultural profile.

Bradley contends that a uniquely high level of lingering Neanderthal aggression, perpetuated by ethnic prohibitions against outside marriage, has been responsible for the major role played by those calling themselves Jews in the discovery and conquest of the Americas, the transatlantic trade in Black Africans as slaves and cultural colonization of non-Whites by the West. It has been a role too often distorted and disguised by loud lamentations of “anti-Semitism.”

To me, this is a formidable example of a Jew writing like a human being in the remarkable tradition of Freedman, Koestler and Sand. But the implications of another actual species out to exterminate its millennia old enemy — perhaps this is Pindar’s original Penalty of an Ancient Grief — evidenced by all of the wreckage of a sabotaged civilization — means something dire.

When a predator — especially a superior one — is out to exterminate every last one of its competitors, it means that no peaceful solution is possible. One need only contemplate the daily condition of the world, mutilated as it is by what Bradley calls the savage Neanderthal heritage of today’s Jewish puppet masters.

The implications of the Neanderthal hypothesis are that no peaceful process of reclaiming the world from the Jews is possible.
