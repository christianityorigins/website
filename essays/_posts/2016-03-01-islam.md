<p><i>I want to live among Muslims for a good long time, especially where their faith is most devout: in this way I expect to hone my appraisement and my eye for all that is European.</i>&nbsp;-- Friedrich Nietzsche, 13 March 1881.</p><p>Nietzschean philosophy is a secularized form of Islam.&nbsp;</p><div><p>1. Friedrich Nietzsche modeled Thus Spoke Zarathustra off of the Quran [<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1622432" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]&nbsp;and stole a lot of his philosophy from Islam (1).</p><p>The will to power (striving for dominance) = Islam's emphasis on strength and discipline and Jihad (internal struggle for self-dominance). Nietzsche’s concept of the self-overcoming = Ihsan (excellence). Overman (Übermensch) = the perfect man (al-insan al-kamil) and Nafs [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafs#:~:text=Nietzsche" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]. "The transvaluation of values" = Sharia (as an antidote). "The gay science" = Fitra. Amor fati = tawakkal. Also, both philosophies are built around the idea that there is inherent suffering in life and the need to find meaning in the face of it.</p><p><i>“My paradise is in the shadow of my sword."</i>&nbsp;-- Friedrich Nietzsche, Ecce Homo.&nbsp;Pg. 80.</p><p><i>"Know that Paradise is under the shadow of swords."</i>&nbsp;--&nbsp;Sahih al-Bukhari. Hadith 2818</p><div>2. According to Friedrich Nietzsche, Christianity and it's secularized variants of Leftism/Marxism, et.al., are jewish [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#Jews,_nationalism_and_European_identity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>] [<a href="http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/genealogy1.htm#:~:text=jews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>] divide-and-conquer slave-morality [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>] systems that work by transvaluating [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaluation_of_values" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>] ethnic values and warrior ethos so that the lowest&nbsp;"chandala" [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschandala" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]&nbsp;outcastes (weakest, debased, traitors, and women) can rise up to become the nobility.&nbsp;<span>However,&nbsp;</span>Islam is a master-morality that worships the warrior caste and power and has firewalls built into it preventing the outcastes from ever having any power over the warrior castes. For example, hating traitors (Kafirs/Infidels) is a foundational part of the Islamic religion and self-deified "universalist" spokespersons/representatives of the tribe or religion are considered Riya and Idolators, the worst type of Kafir (see: Shirk, Idolator, Taghut, Munafiq, Riya). Speaking on behalf of Muslims (as a self-appointed representative), qualifying universalism ("as a 'Muslim' I think..."), or trying to stand in judgement of other Muslims ("shame on you!") would violate the three greatest sins of idolatry in Islam (see: Shirk, Takfir).</div><div><br /></div><div>3. Nietzsche saw democracy [<a href="http://archive.is/ytt7N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>] as another slave-morality, or Christianity applied to politics (<i>"the democratic movement is the heir to Christianity”</i>) which was designed to give the chandala caste power over the aristocratic and warrior castes. Islam is anti-democratic [<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_democracy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>], preferring Caliphates.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion, a master-morality that comes the closest to what Nietzsche envisioned, and one that undermines the universalist claims of both Christianity and modernity (secularized Christianity), would be a sect of Islam that includes the ancient Aryan caste system that he greatly admired (3) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_among_South_Asian_Muslims" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>].</div><div><br /></div><div>Appendix.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div>In Sufism, the ultimate reality is often described as the Unity of Being (Wahdat al-Wujud), or that all existence is interconnected and ultimately one. This idea is rooted in the Quranic concept of Tawhid, or the oneness of God. This cosmology is Plato's monism. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist monists believe this to be matter or energy).&nbsp; Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality. This cosmology makes the most scientific sense</div></div><div><br /></div><div>References</div><div><br /></div><div>1) https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/nietzsche1313/files/2016/12/Ian-Almond-Nietzsches-peace-with-Islam.pdf</div><div>--https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1622432<br /></div></div><div>--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafs#:~:text=Nietzsche</div><div><br /></div><div>2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master–slave_morality</div><div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaluation_of_values</div><div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschandala</div><div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment</div><div><br /></div><div>3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_among_South_Asian_Muslims</div><div>--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti</div><div>--https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Race_and_Tribe</div><div>--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafa%27ah</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Read more</div><div><br /></div><div>https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A"Nietzsche%2C+Friedrich+Wilhelm%2C+1844-1900"&amp;and%5B%5D=language%3A"English"</div><div>https://youtu.be/1wOtoMD4IYg?si=17-_ICK1R62sxdx8</div><div>https://youtu.be/eWqO-V02IzQ?si=6yB9BfFOhB5mmv2t</div><div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Islam</div><div><div>https://web.archive.org/web/20140901183818/http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_converts_to_Mohammedanism</div></div><div>https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/fall-2014-the-great-wars/the-swastika-and-the-crescent</div>
