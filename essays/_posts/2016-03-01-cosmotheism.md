Cosmotheism is a religious concept developed by rocket scientist and physics professor William L. Pierce (1933-2002) in the mid-1970s. He expressed his religious philosophy in early writings and lectures, later presented in three separate pamphlets: The Path, On Living Things, and On Society.

Cosmology: the cosmology is similar to Plato's monism. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist monists believe this to be matter or energy). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality. 

Beliefs: that there is an evolutionary universe, and mankind can take part in his own evolution to become more and more godlike (ubermen). Self-deification.

In his 1976 speech "Our Cause", Pierce said:

_All we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood._
