People

The Middle East/West and South Asia, North Africa were principally populated by Neolithic and Indo-Aryan people up until 2000 years ago (1), with a smaller minority of Semites and Natufians.

Neolithic = people who originated in the Caucuses region and then moved into Europe and south into the Middle East and North Africa in successive waves roughly from 12,000 to 6,400 years ago. They became the Early Anatolian Farmers (EAF) who became the Iranian Hunter-Gatherers/Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers (CHG)/West Anatolians who became proto-Sardinian peoples and East Anatolians migrated further east and went extinct as a minority among unrelated groups who became Iranians, however, a segment of them moved onto India and  became the Harappan civilization. Every ancient Middle Eastern, North African, Indus Valley, Southern European and ancient Northern European civilization (including the Megalith people who built Stonehenge and other megalith structures) was founded by Neolithic people. 

Indo-Aryans = Hyksos into Egypt, Scythians into Persia, Aryans into the Indus Valley, Dorians into Greece \[[link](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D2#:~:text=The%20Greeks%20believed%20the%20ancestors,Dorian%20invasion”%20actually%20took%20place.)\], Kassites into Babylonia, Hittites into Anatolia, Mittani into Syria. Around 2,000 BCE, after the domestication of the horse and the invention of the chariot these Aryans poured down from the Pontic-Caspian steppes. 

Semites = Neanderthal relics who mixed with whatever dominated their ancestors the most: Scythian-Turkic (Cimmerian) mixes from the Pontic-Caspian steppes, Hapiru in Egypt, Neanderthal mixes in Canaan, the Hittites (2) and Natufians who were 1/4 Sub-Saharan African.

Europeans = a mixture of three races to varing degrees: Neolithic, Indo-Aryans, and Alpine. Alpine are Western Hunter Gatherer's (WHG), ie. 'Cheddar Man' who are Indigenous Europeans that were heavily domesticated (brachycephalic skull, short mesomorphic body type, round and juvenile facial features/neoteny, bright pink skin/piebaldism).

Eezekiel 16:1-316: "The word of the Lord came to me: 2 “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices 3 and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites \[Canaan = Modern day Israel\]; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite". The House of Omri (Kingdom of Israel), pronounced phonetically as "Ghomri" (Hebrew) or "Khumri" (Assyrian), and derivatives of those words "Gamera/Gimera" & "ga-me-ra-a-an" (Assyrian) and "Gimiri" (Babylonian) also show up in ancient records as root words for Cimmerian/Scythian.
