Liberal vs conservative physiognomy.

Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) 

\-Conservative men and those self-identified as "far-right" have a high facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) ([ref](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/facial-structure-may-predict-endorsement-of-racial-prejudice.html)).

\*Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) corelates to high prenatal testosterone exposure ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614768/)) and circulating testosterone levels in men ([ref](https://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Lefevre_Lewis_Perrett_Penke_in_press_-_fWHR_and_reactive_T.pdf))

Watch this video and notice how nearly all the Liberals have a low fWHR while the Conservatives are attractive with a high fWHR.

  

  

There is even a "Liberal gene" called the 'dopamine receptor D4 gene' ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_gene)) and this gene is linked to schizophrenia ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902887?dopt=Abstract)), bipolar disease ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902887?dopt=Abstract)), anorexia ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902887?dopt=Abstract)), eating disorders ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902887?dopt=Abstract)), infidelity ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902887?dopt=Abstract)) as well as obsessive compulsive disorder ([ref](http://pharmtao.com/blog1/genetic-basis-anger-polymorphisms-traits-association-variations-depressive-disorder/)), anger ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12497615?dopt=Abstract)), and self-harm ([ref](https://omim.org/entry/601696)). This explains the popularity of "social justice" and other generally self-victimizing/"feel sorry for me" behavior of the left indicates that a lot of them are strongly entrenched in learned helplessness, histrionic personality disorder, and martyr complex's.

Causes

Men who identify as leftists have very low testosterone levels ([ref](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-animals-and-animal-spirits/202307/testosterone-and-politics)) and testosterone supplementation has been shown to turn leftist men into conservatives ([ref](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/155441/version/V1/view)), so the issue is clearly low testosterone and high cortisol. Leftist men were exposed to high levels of cortisol through the mother prenatally (mother was highly stressed while pregnant) ([ref](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5129181/Why-stress-pregnancy-leads-smaller-babies.html)) and/or cortisol exposure during puberty through trauma or bullying. Cortisol obliterates testosterone in the male body ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880087/)), raises estrogen, and being exposed to excessive cortisol, low testosterone, and high estrogen levels prenatally or in their juvenile years when their brains are highly neuroplastic and their faces and bodies are developing would be very damaging. Cortisol destroys phenotypes ("moon facies"), has deleterious effects on the body (Cushing's syndrome, immune suppression, muscle and bone weakness, hair loss, etc.), and hard-wires pathways between the hippocampus and amygdala in a way that increases anxiety. This theory is consistent with a high facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) equating with high prenatal testosterone exposure.

Conclusion

Modern Leftists are the spiteful mutant class. Leftism is the politics of 'ressentiment' \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment)\] and the veneration of the weak. The belief that the inferior deserve the spoils of what their betters have toiled for and earned on merit. They depend on the goodwill of the liberal system to survive. Every single one of them is a sad, bitter, dysgenic mutant hiding in the shadows of society and plotting to drag down the genetically superior. The good news is that through self-selection they will eventually be bred out of the gene pool. Despite liberal propaganda, Women ONLY care about the genetics of a man (as judged by his face), not how progressive or cool he thinks he is, and because of birth control, on demand abortions, women's higher earning levels and e-dating sites/apps where they judge a mans genetic worth within a split-second, they hold all the power as to who they will procreate with, so this makes the process irreversible. Women naturally despise weak or genetically inferior men and their biggest fear (including leftists) is having an [ugly, weak, or gay son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_son_hypothesis). A man carries 50% or more of their mothers DNA and a goodlooking, strong, and healthy son will spread his mothers genes more effectively.

^"But a telling difference emerged among female politicians. The faces of Republican women rated, on average, twice as sex-typical -- or feminine -- as those of Democratic women. And among conservative lawmakers of both genders, women were 13 points more feminine on average than men were masculine. Among more liberal politicians, women were five points more feminine than men were masculine."
