1 Druidism

Christianity is a subversion of Celtic Druidism (1) that was filtered through an imperial cult where Asander of Bosphorus aka Julius Caesar took on the Esus/Esos/Hesus/Aisus/Iesus \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esus)\] role. The Galatians of Anatolia were Celtics who followed Druidism and this religion was subverted by a group of rabbi's headed by rabbi Akiva around the time of the Bar Kohiba revolt (132–136 CE). See: On the Origins of Christianity \[[link](https://christcuck.org/on-the-origins-of-christianity)\]. Converting christians to Druidism should be easy as it is the foundation for their religion with the same deity (Esus/Esos/Hesus/Aisus/Iesus), traditions, and rituals (2), but without the old testament and proto-bolshevism slave-morality.

There are only two things that you need to know to understand Druidry:

1.1 Cosmology

The founder of Druidry was Pythagoras (3) who learned from a philosopher named Abaris the Hyperborean \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaris_the_Hyperborean)\] (possibly the same person) who was a Scythian who hailed from Hyperborea. "And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this philosophy" -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus. 

So, the Druid cosmology was Pythagorian monism \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)\]. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality. As for the polytheistic deities, some polytheistic monists see the polytheistic deities as sentient personal gods who eminate from the divine, others see them as symbolic representations of natural forces (numen/animism) (4), others are atheists (5) who are attracted to tradition, ancestor veneration, and ancestry. Some atheistic Pagans are inspired by Carl Jung who combined psychoanalysis with Heathenry (6); the polytheistic deities = 'archetypes (7) of the collective unconscious (8)' to these Pagans.

1.2 Rituals

Rituals are about manifesting the deities/forces of nature/laws of physics into your daily life. In the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries (9), the rituals were believed to provide initiates with profound insights into the nature of reality, the cycle of life and death, and the interconnectedness of all things. They also served important social functions, such as reinforcing community bonds, resolving conflicts, and marking life transitions (see: the Olympic Games and the festival of Dionysus). To secular Pagans who are inspired by Carl Jung, rituals are ways of manifesting the Jungian archetypes into your life, inducing 'active imagination' (10), or a part of the process of 'individuation' (11)

1\. The word Druid comes from the Welsh word Derwydd which using the alphabet of the time would have been spelt Deruid. Dar + Gwydd (Dar + Guid using the alphabet of the time). Dar means an male oak; the tree of presence. Gwydd (Guid) means a state or recognition or knowledge. Using the old spelling Guid, that is where the term Guide comes from. So Derwydd/Deruid and therefore Druid means one has knowledge and presence; one who has the knowledge of the tree of presence; one who has the knowledge of the male oak; a theologian; a spiritual guide. It suggests a connection to ancestral knowledge or traditional wisdom, as oak trees are often seen as ancient beings, standing as witnesses to history. Having the knowledge of the oak tree, then, might imply possessing insight that is enduring, deeply rooted, and grounded in both experience and a broader understanding of the world and passed down from generation to generation, the source of ancient knowledge.
Druid = Drvo (Slavic) = Dhruva (Sanskrit).\
2\. Winter Solstice Celebrations: Christmas, celebrated on December 25, coincides with the ancient pagan festival of Yule, which marked the winter solstice. Druids would light fires and decorate trees to symbolize the return of the sun. Easter and the Spring Equinox: Easter, falls around the spring equinox. Druids celebrated the festival of Ostara, which honored the goddess Eostre, often depicted with eggs and rabbits. These symbols have been co-opted by Christianity, with eggs representing new life and rabbits symbolizing fertility. The Celebration of the Summer Solstice: Druids would celebrate the summer solstice with bonfires and rituals to honor the sun. Christianity's celebration of St. John's Day (June 24) coincides with the summer solstice, and some traditions involve lighting bonfires. The Celebration of the Autumn Equinox: Druids would celebrate the autumn equinox with rituals to honor the harvest. Christianity's celebration of the Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6) coincides with the autumn equinox in some parts of the world.\
3\. The Irish annals talk about a Druid named Abhras visiting Greece. The Druids were a Pythagorian cult: "And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this philosophy" -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus. In the same book St. Hippolytus says: "Pyrrho was an Academic; this (speculator) taught the in-comprehensibility of everything. The Brahmins among the Indians, and the Druids among the Celts, and Hesiod (devoted themselves to philosophic pursuits)". In my book, 'On the Origins of Christianity', I identify Pyrrho of Elis as the creator of Buddism. Zalmoxis was another name of Sabazius, the Thracian version of Zeus. Also, Zalmoxis, or Zalmox or Zalmos, can also be pronounced Salmos which is very close to the Aramaic and Hebrew pronunciation of Solomon. Abraham = 'Ram the Druid', a seer who cured his tribe with mistletoe. He was exiled and took an army with him. He created the caste system in India, created the Magi in Persia. 'A Brahman', a Vedic spiritual leader/teacher, comes from him (*This 'Ram' character shows up many times in history under different aliases in different locations: Ra in Egyptian mythology. Abrahamn (Abraham = Ab Ram, or 'Born of Ram') in the bible. Ram the Aries. Ram/Ramos the Druid. Rama in the Vedas who is a major deity and worshipped as the seventh avatars of Vishnu. In Tibet he is Lama. Speculation: In the Vedas 'Laxman' is the younger brother of 'Rama'. A'lex'ander -> 'Lax'man. So, Ram was Alexander the Great's older brother? The jews plagiarized and bastardized Druidism for their religion and then used this religion as the template for christinaity. See: On the Origins of Christianity [[link](https://christcuck.org/on-the-origins-of-christianity)]\. 
). The name "Abaris" and the Greek word "αβαρίς" (abarís), which is a variant of the word "απαρίς" (aparís), meaning "from the far north" or "Hyperborean". This word is also related to the Greek word "απαρτίζω" (apartizō), which means "to purify" or "to cleanse", similar to the first part of Pythagoras' name. So, was Pythagoras also Abaris the Hyperborean? Very likely.\

--These Pagans don't worship a particular thing, they just appreciate the unity of existence, or seek to understand the ultimate nature of reality. Ancestor veneration is the only worship they do.\
5\. Terminology: "Pagan" (Latin: pāgānus, 'rural') was supposed to be a slur that was invented by the catholic church to apply to every non-xtian religion but has since been reappropriated as a general term. Specific ethnic "Pagan" polytheistic religions are: Heathenry is Germanic Paganism ("Asatru" is one of the religions that fall under the Heathenry category). Fyrnsidu is Brittonic Paganism. Druidry is Celtic Paganism. Hellenism is Greek Paganism. Religio Romana is Roman Paganism. Rodnovery is Slavic Paganism. Romuva is Baltic Paganism, etc. Every polytheistic ancestral European religion is similar, the deities just have different regional names, ex:Dyaus Pita (Vedic), Zeus (Greek), Jupiter (Roman), Odin (Nordic), Wotan (German), Esus (Celtic), Wotanaz (Slavic), Ukko and Väinämöinen (Finnish), and so on are all derived from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of Dyeus, and Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter'. Wotan is derived from Proto-Germanic Wodanaz, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European root Dyeus. Odin comes from Old Norse and is related to the earlier Proto-Germanic Wodanaz.
