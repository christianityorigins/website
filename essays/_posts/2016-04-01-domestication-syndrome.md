Did Christianity Cause Domestication Syndrome \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_syndrome)\] \[[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/#!po=8.25243)\] and Human Self-Domestication \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-domestication)\] in the West?

Traits of domestication syndrome:

Behavioral:

*   Low in-group preference or sense of tribalism ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635723000888))
*   As part of the system of self-domestication animals begin self-policing group members to enforce the norms of the group and deter other members from behaving in ways that could disrupt the social order. Ex. dogs are often seen growling at or barking at other dogs who they see as behaving inappropriately.
*   No sense of self-agency, independence, and follows orders (once domesticated, being part of the herd becomes more important than being right.) ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40656-020-00315-0))
*   Less threat reactivity
*   Poor maternal instincts ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5857534/))

Phenotype:

*   Neoteny ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096361/)) ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/)) ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Neoteny)) and feminization ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Feminization)) in males
*   Brachycephaly (short and round skulls which leads to a reduction of the back of the brain and a smaller amygdala (1))
*   Weak jaws
*   'Prey eyes' as opposed to 'hunter eyes' [[link](https://incels.wiki/w/Hunter_eyes)\]
*   Low muscle mass in males
*   Poor eyesight ([ref](https://books.google.ca/books?id=hEy4AAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y))
*   Incompletely developed neural crest which leads to craniofacial abnormalities, neurological problems, lower intelligence, vision problems ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8633094/)) ([ref](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140714100122.htm/))
*   Notice how the entirety of the working classes in every western country has the domesticated phenotype \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/basic/Alpinid.html)\] or else the pig phenotype? \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/Borreby.html)\] (including pink skin tone \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebald)\]). This is the same species-specific domestication process that turned a wolf into a dog \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeSGC_O5_OZYOjFaf9X2b3IGFI2pMPPPILGE2rzzUWfYxgxFatcP81ZTa6BPMn4xLUPjASDJX41whJGBZgGuMefddh-OXbKLzeChjUF2K4uQaVMMEI1A__HSnsL1LfRbxFQm2RdSt-4RLcGAXqokw5E54pW4i8OXTsScuMdgeSLkDAVtuiwpOxXMyWl9E/s1500/wolfvsdog.jpg)\] and a wild boar into a domesticated pig \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT_wCGxsxJY-7-NPKEliqxVFLud2sWiXE_wFQr7tS1G3-hqk2kmZzoy1UaKbN8kq8RCrFb6SygHVRWNGMjCC93zNc7w1nYX0oQypFf-sEenu_XjIE-GVHUU7uLXydpcjQKdilC2zmowNn4yGvsO8MqAwYyjdQgUpem4CjnFFaF7D_47oI42wyzaagTRnI/s1536/wild-boar-vs-pig-collage.jpg)\]

In Christianity, and its secularized variant of leftism, all these behavioral traits of domestication become virtues. See:Â [Christianity as a Slave Morality Religion and its Modern Secularized Variants: A Jewish Conspiracy and Hoax on the Gentiles](https://www.christcuck.org/p/christianity-and-its-modern-secularized.html). Self-hate, out-group preference, pacifism, self-policing "heretics", monotheism/moral absolutism/thinking in absolute binary terms, etc.

  

So, has the Christian domestication system (2) completely changed the genotype of billions of people?

  

Studies:

[The Church, intensive kinship, and global psychological variation by Schulz et al. (2019)](https://archive.ph/o/IhiVD/https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6466/eaau5141)

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-catholic-church-may-have-helped-spark-western-individualism (another study that came to the same conclusion).

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183015 (study that tested implicit and explicit intergroup race bias among Native Americans. They found that Native Americans showed a strong implicit preference for their own group over other groups, but this preference was totally eliminated when they were primed with christianity).

1\. There's a theory that supports the "autistic brain" (as of the extreme male brain theory) is a brain with a tendency to be undomesticated or "failed domestication" [[link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201608/autism-and-domestication-syndrome-in-humans)\]. Undomesticated people are socialized to a lesser degree therefore fall less for propaganda. Schizophrenia is the opposite of this and is a form of hyper-domestication syndrome [[link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201609/schizophrenics-hyper-domesticated-humans)] (see also: testosterone supplementation reverses symptoms of schizophrenia [[link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18626263/)\]). On this topic, see: Liberal men [the pinnacle of domesticated human form] turn Conservative after testosterone supplementation [[link](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/155441/version/V1/view)]. \
\--People who identify as conservative have a larger amygdala \[[link](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-political-ideology-differences-brain-previously.html)\]  
\--Anthropologists who look at ancient cities throughout history have found that as soon as a city pops up a populations skull size decreases substantially, most likely due to self domestication.\
2\. It is important to note that feudalism was invented simultaneously as institutional Christianity. Both by Constantine, one to enforce the other and vice versa. For 2000 years, Europeans have lived, and evolved, within this domestication system.
