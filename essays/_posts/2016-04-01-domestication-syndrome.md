Did Christianity Cause Domestication Syndrome \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_syndrome)\] \[[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/#!po=8.25243)\] and Human Self-Domestication \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-domestication)\] in the West?

Traits of domestication syndrome:

Behavioral:

*   Low in-group preference or sense of tribalism ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635723000888))
*   As part of the system of self-domestication animals begin self-policing group members to enforce the norms of the group and deter other members from behaving in ways that could disrupt the social order. Ex. dogs are often seen growling at or barking at other dogs who they see as behaving inappropriately.
*   No sense of self-agency, independence, and follows orders (once domesticated, being part of the herd becomes more important than being right) ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40656-020-00315-0))
*   Less threat reactivity
*   Poor maternal instincts ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5857534/))

Phenotype:

*   Neoteny ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096361/)) ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/)) ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Neoteny)) and feminization ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Feminization)) in males (neotony and feminization comes from hormonal adaptation to domestication. I.e. no pressure for epigenetic expression of high testosterone)
*   Brachycephaly (short and round skulls) which leads to a reduction of the back of the brain and a smaller amygdala (1). This expresses in political affiliation: people who identify as conservative have a larger amygdala \[[link](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-political-ideology-differences-brain-previously.html)\] 
*   Smaller skull in volume ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/#!po=8.25243/))
*   Weak jaws
*   Lower muscle mass in males
*   Lower testosterone in males
*   Smaller penis sizes in males
*   Poor eyesight ([ref](https://books.google.ca/books?id=hEy4AAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y))
*   Incompletely developed neural crest which leads to craniofacial abnormalities, neurological problems, lower intelligence, and vision problems ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8633094/)) ([ref](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140714100122.htm/))
*   Notice how the majority of European (especially northern) people now have the domesticated phenotype \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/basic/Alpinid.html)\] or else the pig phenotype? \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/Borreby.html)\] (including pink skin tone \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebald)\]). This is the same species-specific domestication process that turned a wolf into a dog \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeSGC_O5_OZYOjFaf9X2b3IGFI2pMPPPILGE2rzzUWfYxgxFatcP81ZTa6BPMn4xLUPjASDJX41whJGBZgGuMefddh-OXbKLzeChjUF2K4uQaVMMEI1A__HSnsL1LfRbxFQm2RdSt-4RLcGAXqokw5E54pW4i8OXTsScuMdgeSLkDAVtuiwpOxXMyWl9E/s1500/wolfvsdog.jpg)\] and a wild boar into a domesticated pig \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT_wCGxsxJY-7-NPKEliqxVFLud2sWiXE_wFQr7tS1G3-hqk2kmZzoy1UaKbN8kq8RCrFb6SygHVRWNGMjCC93zNc7w1nYX0oQypFf-sEenu_XjIE-GVHUU7uLXydpcjQKdilC2zmowNn4yGvsO8MqAwYyjdQgUpem4CjnFFaF7D_47oI42wyzaagTRnI/s1536/wild-boar-vs-pig-collage.jpg)\]

In Christianity, and its secularized variant of leftism, all these behavioral traits of domestication become virtues. See:Â [Christianity as a Slave Morality Religion and its Modern Secularized Variants: A Jewish Conspiracy and Hoax on the Gentiles](https://christcuck.org/christianity-and-its-secularized-variants/). 


So, has the Christian domestication system (2) completely changed the genotype of billions of people?


1\. There's a theory that supports the "autistic brain" (as of the extreme male brain theory) is a brain with a tendency to be undomesticated or "failed domestication" [[link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201608/autism-and-domestication-syndrome-in-humans)\]. Undomesticated people are socialized to a lesser degree therefore fall less for propaganda. Schizophrenia is the opposite of this and is a form of hyper-domestication syndrome [[link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201609/schizophrenics-hyper-domesticated-humans)] (see also: testosterone supplementation reverses symptoms of schizophrenia [[link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18626263/)\]), so is Down's Syndrome (see: Down's Syndrome is treated with testosterone supplementation [[link](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/01/hormone-therapy-may-boost-brain-function-for-people-with-downs-syndrome-study-finds)]), and homosexuality is another expression of domestication syndrome [[link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02955/full)] (see: exposure to a high concentration of testosterone during a critical phase of development leads to a male-typical orientation [[link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739566/)]). On this topic, see: Liberal men turn Conservative after testosterone supplementation [[link](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/155441/version/V1/view)\]. \
2\. It is important to note that feudalism was invented simultaneously as institutional Christianity. Both by Constantine, one to enforce the other and vice versa. For 2000 years, Europeans have lived, and evolved, within this domestication system.
