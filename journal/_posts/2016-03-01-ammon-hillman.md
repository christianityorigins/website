Ammon Hillman is a professor of classics and a Koine Greek translator who read the earliest codex's of the bible in its original Koine and discovered a lot of disturbing things that were covered up in later translations. Essentially, in his book _Original Sin: Ritual Child Rape & The Church_ (2012) \[[link](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Sin-Ritual-Child-church/dp/1579511449)\] he writes that Christinaity started out as a pedophile cult and priests targeted Pagan children, orphans, and homeless children. The goal of the church wasn't just to give pedophile priests access to children, but also to use child rape as a shock tool, to spoil the youth of the children, emasculate and ruin multiple generations of boys to ensure submission, and to strike fear into the hearts of young boys. Child rape was at the root of their program and they even recuited pedophiles among the population to become priests for this purpose. 

The insitutional and ritualized rape of children over the past two thousand years (1) by the church wasn't a bug, it was a feature (2).

Some quotes:

_"In a strange twist of history, the first rape of children by Christian priests was a means of asserting political and social dominance over pagan religions that venerated the beauty of sexual attraction. Christian priests justified this act as the replication of a mystery performed originally by Jesus himself. Ritual child rape was an integral element of early Christian religion._

Christianity fostered a religious hatred of women while the priests were raping the boys:

_The leadership of the early Church clearly recognized the value of ritual sodomy as a successful means of rooting out the influence of female allure on pubescent boys. Raping young men was a highly effective means of combating more-popular, sexcentered pagan religions; these mystery rites were meant to prevent young converts from ever following the cults of Aphrodite and Dionysus, but they also established a degree of exclusivity not present in competing mystery cults. When early Christians were born again, they were psychologically unique, as a direct result of the ritual rape they endured."_

_"They outlawed the open celebration of feminine beauty by arguing that sexual appeal was akin to spiritual crime. When Jesus claimed that looking at a woman was a sin, his words were an intentional slap in the face of the Greco-Roman culture that permeated his homeland._

_The Christian drive to control sexual desire was not simply a result of the Mosaic commandments. The Jewish founders of Christianity who modified their Mosaic imperatives did so in order to control the sexuality of women. The Church fathers were interested in controlling female sexuality for one very important reason: the feminine voice expressed by pagan cults prevented the Church from gaining political power in Rome._

_The Christian world looked upon the pre-pubertal and adolescent years of human life in a very different way from their pagan neighbors. Sexual development, for the Church fathers, was a degrading process, something best covered, hidden and ignored. Because the pagans publicly celebrated and even worshipped the bloom of youth, they found themselves in direct conflict with Church authorities._

_The view of adolescence as a period of shame in the life of any individual provided Christian priests with a firmer justification for horrendous sexual acts of “purification” committed against minors. Puberty’s physical transformation of young boys into sexually developed young men was interpreted by the Church as an avenue of temptation. Since sexual sin was believed to be spiritually lethal, Christian priests felt justified in using extreme measures to prevent it._

_The ritual sodomizing of young boys was undertaken as a response to the pagan veneration of the bloom of youth. However, it wasn’t just a movement against youth. It was also an attempt to strike at the very heart of paganism._

_Ritual rape committed by the Church was very much an attempt to stifle the veneration of pubertal development, and the potential contribution of young boys and girls to society._

The church paralyzed child protection. The Church Fathers replaced females as guadians of children, as was the norm in Pagan socieities, so that they had access to children:

_By attacking the concept of women as Nature’s nurturers, the Church asserted a single-minded vision of masculine authority that cut to the quick of the psyche of its initiates. This war against the image of the mothering goddess was dangerous, because it undercut much of the bedrock of civilization—and also gave priests more authority to abuse young boys._

_Christianity didn’t just undercut the authority of women as the rightful protectors of children; it took the additional step of ensuring against any sort of concerted feminine reaction to child abuse within the Church by entirely vilifying the role of women in society. Priests facilitated the rape of children in the early centuries of the Common Era by declaring women--and even femininity itself--to be criminal_

_Christian Zealots brutally and publicly murdered prominent and educated women like Hypatia, after branding them as “witches,” or followers of Lucifer, but their efforts to control the feminine world also included a brilliant, behind-the-scenes reshaping of the western mind_ (is this why western women are so conformist to dominant ideologies like leftism today?)

_Before Christian monks began teaching that women were cursed, the Greco-Roman world worshipped the benevolent power of the feminine voice. The Greeks and Romans taught that women were politically relevant; they believed that women possessed a unique, divinely inspired ability to create beauty. They believed the cosmos had endowed women with gifts that were entirely absent in their male counterparts. The preChristian Mediterranean world believed the feminine voice was uniquely powerful— they believed it was a reflection of the highest creative force of the universe. In the pagan mind, the creator was not a man, but a child-nourishing woman._

_In the early Christian centuries, a woman’s appearance, like her voice, became tainted with the stain of moral, spiritual, and political corruption. Priests and monks taught that women should be entirely covered in public. Sexual inactivity was praised as a virtue, and female allure became an object of derision and loathing. The early priesthood effortlessly cultivated a virulent hatred and anxiety for the political expression of women that was directly linked to their sexuality._

_When this novel view of sex as a spiritually significant, masculine act was combined with the emerging Christian belief in the virtue of suffering and the value of temptation for the purification of the soul, the first institutional pedophiles were born. For decades, Christian priests had taught that their God used special trials of temptation to cleanse, test and initiate believers. Special priests known as “exorcists” believed that they could summon the devil himself, and that by way of possession, they could apply the “fires of temptation” to an initiate, in order to establish these new believers as members of the body of Christ. Otherwise stated, priests forced young candidates for baptism to confront sexual pleasure in the form of rape; in a dominant, masculine role, priests tempted young initiates with forced sexual acts, in order to encourage them to flee the sin and prove themselves as secure followers of Jesus._

_All levels of the Christian hierarchy, including priests, exorcists and even bishops, advocated and defended the use of ritual sodomy. It appears that the ritual was most prominent in the catechetical school of Alexandria, and likely finds its origins there. It is also likely that the gospel writer Mark actually founded the catechetical school in Alexandria. Many Church leaders, including Clement, Origen and Jerome, were involved in its rigorous method of training of new converts._

_According to our ancient catechetical sources, if you were a Christian priest living in the earliest era of the Church, you knew what had to be done. Remove the masses of unfortunate, orphaned children from the streets, a few at a time, and prepare them for salvation; starve them, recite numerous creeds to them with a steady, droning, persistent repetition, and then gather them together into the secret chamber, a place that only priests were allowed to frequent. A place where the devil could be summoned; a place where a priest could forever purge them of their desire for sexual intimacy._

_Every good Christian knew that young boys, particularly orphaned children without the protection of living parents, were susceptible to sexual impurity—something that would drag their souls directly to Hell. The only way to purge this impulse, the only way to save their souls, was to force them to undergo a sacred ceremony, a mysterious initiation that would forever cleanse them of inappropriate sexual pleasure and deliver them to Christ_

_Even a cursory look at the earliest writings of the Christians reveals that ritual rape was an institutional standard used in processing initiates. It is not unreasonable to assume that the theological justification for sodomizing young boys is still present in the ranks of Catholic priests. The rape of children in the modern Christian Church may not be as organized as it was when the Church first developed, but child abuse clearly remains an institutional problem. For reasons that continue to elude investigators, the Church actively fosters and protects the practice of child molestation and sexual assault. Priests have sexually abused children for centuries, and bishops have always protected these rapists from prosecution. The Catholic Church has remained very much the same for two thousand years. The problem of child rape may never be rooted out of the Church, because it is integral to the very foundations of Christianity._

My theory is that there was a Byzantine imperial cult where Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, and Cleopatra = Dynamis Ourania. Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who carried the title ‘king of kings’, and her uncle was Mithridates ‘Chrestus', etc. Then a couple centuries later Emperor Hadrian, who was the heir to this imperial cult, created a cult to worship his underage gay lover called the cult of Antinous \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous)\] likely using the imperial cult as the foundation. One of the scribes for this religion was Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos who a nephew of Hadrian (the midrash. Tanhuma. 41a, Mishpatim 3). Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos was a student of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva's other students included Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope, Shimon bar Yochai, Aristo of Pella aka Luke the Evangelist, and Hegesippus aka Josephus. These rabbis were active in a time and area as Apollonius of Tyana, so they were likely contemporaries. During the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE) these rabbis were engaging in creating psy-op relgions, for example, _The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai_ was a blueprint to destroy "Edom" (Rome) and was the manuscript for Islam to weaponize the Arabs to attack the Romans, so it is possible that they used this a an opportunity to foist on the Romans a psy-op relgion to strip them of their will to power, but also to give them a religious commandment that granted them access to their children as a part of the system to break the Romans.
