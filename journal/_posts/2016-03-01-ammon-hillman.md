Ammon Hillman is a professor of classics and a Koine Greek translator who read the earliest codex's of the bible in its original Koine and discovered a lot of disturbing things that were covered up in later translations. Essentially, in his book _Original Sin: Ritual Child Rape & The Church_ (2012) \[[link](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Sin-Ritual-Child-church/dp/1579511449)\] he writes that Christinaity started as a pedophile cult and priests targeted Pagan children, orphans, and homeless children. The goal of the church wasn't just pedophilic desire, but also to use child rape as a shock tool, to spoil the youth of the children, and a to strike fear into the hearts of Pagans.  

Essentially, the insitutional and ritualized rape of children over the past two thousand years (1) by the church wasn't a bug, it was a feature (2).

Some quotes:

_"In a strange twist of history, the first rape of children by Christian priests was a means of asserting political and social dominance over pagan religions that venerated the beauty of sexual attraction. Christian priests justified this act as the replication of a mystery performed originally by Jesus himself. Ritual child rape was an integral element of early Christian religion._

Christianity fostered a religious hatred of women while the priests were raping the boys.

_The leadership of the early Church clearly recognized the value of ritual sodomy as a successful means of rooting out the influence of female allure on pubescent boys. Raping young men was a highly effective means of combating more-popular, sexcentered pagan religions; these mystery rites were meant to prevent young converts from ever following the cults of Aphrodite and Dionysus, but they also established a degree of exclusivity not present in competing mystery cults. When early Christians were born again, they were psychologically unique, as a direct result of the ritual rape they endured."_

_"They outlawed the open celebration of feminine beauty by arguing that sexual appeal was akin to spiritual crime. When Jesus claimed that looking at a woman was a sin, his words were an intentional slap in the face of the Greco-Roman culture that permeated his homeland._

_The Christian drive to control sexual desire was not simply a result of the Mosaic commandments. The Jewish founders of Christianity who modified their Mosaic imperatives did so in order to control the sexuality of women. The Church fathers were interested in controlling female sexuality for one very important reason: the feminine voice expressed by pagan cults prevented the Church from gaining political power in Rome._

_The Christian world looked upon the pre-pubertal and adolescent years of human life in a very different way from their pagan neighbors. Sexual development, for the Church fathers, was a degrading process, something best covered, hidden and ignored. Because the pagans publicly celebrated and even worshipped the bloom of youth, they found themselves in direct conflict with Church authorities._

_The view of adolescence as a period of shame in the life of any individual provided Christian priests with a firmer justification for horrendous sexual acts of “purification” committed against minors. Puberty’s physical transformation of young boys into sexually developed young men was interpreted by the Church as an avenue of temptation. Since sexual sin was believed to be spiritually lethal, Christian priests felt justified in using extreme measures to prevent it._

_The ritual sodomizing of young boys was undertaken as a response to the pagan veneration of the bloom of youth. However, it wasn’t just a movement against youth. It was also an attempt to strike at the very heart of paganism._

_Ritual rape committed by the Church was very much an attempt to stifle the veneration of pubertal development, and the potential contribution of young boys and girls to society._

My theory is that there was a Byzantine imperial cult where Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, and Cleopatra = Dynamis Ourania. Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who carried the title ‘king of kings’, and her uncle was Mithridates ‘Chrestus', etc. Then a couple centuries later Emperor Hadrian, who was the heir to this imperial cult, created a cult to worship his underage gay lover called the cult of Antinous \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous)\] likely using the imperial cult as the foundation. One of the scribes for this religion was Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos who a nephew of Hadrian (The midrash. Tanhuma. 41a, Mishpatim 3). Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos was a student of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva's other students included Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope, Shimon bar Yochai, Aristo of Pella aka Luke the Evangelist, and Hegesippus aka Josephus. These rabbis were active in a time and area as Apollonius of Tyana, so they were likely contemporaries. During the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE) these rabbis were engaging in creating psy-op relgions, for example, _The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai_ was a blueprint to destroy "Edom" (Rome) and was the manuscript for Islam to weaponize the Arabs to attack the Romans, so it is possible that they used this a an oppurtunity to foist on the Romans a psy-op relgion to strip them of their will to power, but also to give them a religious commandment that granted them access to their children as a part of the system to break the Romans.
