Welcome to the homepage of Ralph Perrier (B.A. Philosophy). I am an independent researcher who has a general interest in heterodox ideas, oddities, and mysteries. Recently, I have developed a particular focus on religion and its influence on Western civilization. On this website, you will find working drafts of my first two books, research articles, and various resources.
