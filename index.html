Welcome to the homepage of Ralph Perrier (B.A. Philosophy). I am an independent researcher who has a general interest in heterodox ideas, oddities, and mysteries. Recently, I have developed a particular focus on religion and its influence on Western civilization. On this website, you will find working drafts of my first two books, research articles, and various resources.

You can follow and chat with me on <a href="https://x.com/hereticalbooks">X</a>. Read some articles on <a href="https://x.com/hereticalbooks">Academia.edu</a>
