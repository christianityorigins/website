Welcome to the homepage of Ralph Perrier (B.A. Philosophy). I am an independent researcher who has a general interest in heterodox ideas, oddities, and mysteries. Recently, I have developed a particular focus on religion and its influence on Western civilization. On this website, you will find working drafts of my first two books, research articles, and various resources.

For inquiries or academic correspondence, please <a href="mailto:christianityexposed@yandex.com">email</a> me directly. You can also follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/hereticalbooks" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
