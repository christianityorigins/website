Homepage of Hugo Pepe (B.A. Philosophy). I am an independent researcher who has a general interest in heterodox ideas and oddities and mysteries. Recently, I have developed a particular focus on religion and its influence on Western culture. On this website, you will find working drafts of my first two books, academic research articles, and various resources.
