Source of the below chart: https://web.archive.org/web/20240113043329/https://thenazareneway.com/MM%20Chart.htm \[[link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240113043329/https://thenazareneway.com/MM%20Chart.htm)\] This reference guide was was my starting point to understanding the many aliases this family used. Note: Asander of Bosphorus = Julius Caesar, Dynamis = Cleopatra, Mark Antony = King Herod, so this chart confuses some of their aliases with those of Cleopatra and Mark Antony's grandchildren.

The same authors book _Following Philo to Pallas (the Freedman): The Most Powerful Man in First Century Rome, also known as Goddess (the Mother)_ (2019) by P.J. Gott https://www.amazon.com/Following-Philo-Pallas-Freedman-Powerful-ebook/dp/B07PXKQGYG \[[link](https://www.amazon.com/Following-Philo-Pallas-Freedman-Powerful-ebook/dp/B07PXKQGYG/)\] revealed that Philo of Alexandria was a pen-name for Cleopatra of Mauretania who was married to her brother Alexander (grandson of King Herod)/Ptolemy of Mauretania, therefore, she was the mother of Tiberius Julius Alexander/Arrius Piso. Also, that she was Claudius and Nero's secretary 'Pallas' and Vespasian's first cousin and mistress Antonia Caenis \


~ Magdalene's Men ~

_**The historic identities of the many men in Mary Magdalene's life**._ 

> - - -
> 
> > **Mary Magdalene was accused of "having many men." She was labeled "A Prostitute." Her "many men," were in fact, her one and only husband who is known to history under several aliases. It was the only way to preserve his real identity while also returning the lands of his birthright to him. He was the grandson of Herod the Great and Hasmonean princess, Mariamme, giving him the right to be called, _King of Judea, King of the Jews_. Judea had once been a part of Arabia, which encompassed the Parthian Empire, the Kingdoms of Media, Adiabene, Persia, Armenia, Edessa, Cappadocia, Commagene,** **Cilicia and Syria. _By the end of his life he had become "King" of all those lands - and so very much more!_**
