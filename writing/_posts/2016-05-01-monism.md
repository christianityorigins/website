1 Monism

Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality.

Monism comes from Pythagoras (1) who was a student of Abaris the Hyperborean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaris_the_Hyperborean \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaris_the_Hyperborean)\]) (Druidism), and Vedism is the eastern branch of Druidism that was brought to India by Ram the Druid (Rama in the Vedas) (https://www.academia.edu/13113385/Druidism_and_Vedism_Compared \[[link](https://www.academia.edu/13113385/Druidism_and_Vedism_Compared)\]).

Monist religions are: Pythagorianism, Stoicism, Platonism, Druidism (2), Vedism, Sufi Islam (Wahdat al-Wujud" which translates to "the unity of existence" or "the oneness of being").

2 Types of Monism 

There are different types of monism: materialistic monists (all is matter) believe that everything is made of matter, and even things like thoughts or consciousness are just products of physical processes. This view aligns with atheism. Idealistic monism (all is mind) is the opposite, where everything is fundamentally mental or spiritual, and the physical world is a manifestation of mind or consciousness. This equates to panpsychism. Neutral monism (a mix of both) posits that there's a single substance or principle from which both mind and matter arise, but it's neither purely mental nor purely physical. 

2.2 Priority Monism ("the whole is prior to its parts")

Monism posits that there exists only a single thing, the universe, which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things. Priority monism (or henotheism) is how monist cosmology applies to polytheistic European religions: in a monist-henotheist system, the one substance or ultimate reality (the monad) could be considered the supreme or highest deity, with lower deities or gods being personifications of natural forces (numen/animism) or manifestations or emanations of this ultimate reality. This would mean that the lower deities are not separate, independent entities, but rather symbolic expressions of the one underlying substance.\

3 Scientific Basis

The scientific basis for monism lies in the concept of unity and interconnectedness, where everything is composed of the same fundamental building blocks, such as atoms and subatomic particles. This idea is supported by various scientific theories, including Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Causal Dynamical Triangulation, which suggest that the universe is ultimately made up of a single, underlying substance or reality. As a result, monism can be seen as a logical and coherent system that transcends religious or spiritual beliefs, making it accessible to even atheists who can appreciate the unity and simplicity of the natural world, without necessarily invoking supernatural or divine entities. \

4 Beliefs

in monist religions, monist cosmology posits that all phenomena reduces to one principle and the universe is composed of a single fundamental substance. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in monist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

Core Idea: You’re a piece of the cosmic puzzle, not a stranger to it. The divine is in everything; self-awareness is key.  

5 Rituals

In monist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are used to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and is aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality.

6 Conclusion

Monism is a cosmology. Monist religions are: Pythagorianism, Stoicism, Platonism, Druidism, Vedism, Sufi Islam. So, use monism as a foundation and then add in your beliefs and rituals and you have a logical religious system that can appeal to theists, polytheists, and athiests.

1\. Druidism is the religion that was subverted to make Christianity, so Christians going to Druidism can continue celebrating the same traditions, symbolism, and holidays, just with a monist cosmology. Druidic Calendar: Yule (Winter Solstice) - December 21/22 Celebrate the rebirth of the sun (Christian Equivalent: Christmas (December 25)). Imbolc - February 1/2 Mark the midpoint between Yule and the spring equinox (Christian Equivalent: Candlemas (February 2)). Ostara (Spring Equinox) - March 20/21 Welcome the return of spring with eggs, rabbits, and feasting (Cristian Equivalent: Easter (movable date, typically in March or April)). Beltane - May 1/2 Honor the spirits of the land and the cycles of nature (Christian Equivalent: May Day (May 1) or Ascension Day (movable date, typically in May)). Litha (Summer Solstice) - June 20/21 Celebrate the peak of the sun's power (Christian Equivalent: St. John's Day (June 24)). Lammas - July 31/August 1 Mark the beginning of harvest time (Christian Equivalent: Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6) or Lammas Sunday (movable date, typically in August)). Mabon (Autumn Equinox) - September 20/21 Celebrate the second harvest (Christian Equivalent: Michaelmas (September 29) or Harvest Festival (movable date, typically in September or October)). Samhain - October 31/November 1 Honor the ancestors (Christian Equivalent: All Saints' Eve (October 31) or All Souls' Day (November 2)) \
--Drudry, like it's eastern branch of Vedism, was heirarchal and divided people into four hierarchical castes: priestly or intellectual caste (Druid = Brahman), warriors (Fláith = Kshatriyas), merchants (Bó-Aire = Vaishyas), workers (Fuidir = Shudras). Unlike Christianity's concept of equality before God, this religion didn't promote universal equality. Rulers or warriors derived their authority from intelligence, strength and lineage, not a universal god. \
--In Masonry, many of the ceremonies of the Druids are preserved in their original state. The Druid caste system also served as the system of grades of initiation in Masonry. Side-note: these organizations (freemasons and other secret societies) gained tremendous power and were able to influence the course of history. Religion is a necessary core value system to form groups, so this is obviously one that works (hierarchical/anti-universalist, exclusive, high in-group preference, etc). \
2\. "And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this philosophy"_ -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus. Diodorus Siculus, Book V, §26-32 (36 BCE), and Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor, among other contemporaneous sources, also refer to the Druids as "Pythagorean".
