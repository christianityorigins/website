The Prussian Educational System

Martin Luther (1), a key figure in the Protestant Reformation, played a significant role in shaping the Prussian education system (2), which would later become the model for Western education. Luther's views on education were heavily influenced by his Christian beliefs, as evident in his writings. In his Large Catechism (3), Luther emphasized the importance of obedience and faith over reason and critical thinking.

The Catholic Church has been engaging in suppressing critical thinking and intellectual inquiry since its inception. Critical thinking is a threat to faith and this is why the church has been trying to destroy this ability in Europeans. The issuing of Papal Bulls, to the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, which was a list of banned books that was established in the 16th century, to prohibiting the teaching of philosophy and other subjects deemed "heretical" (4), to the Condemnations of 1210-1277, which were a series of decrees further restricting the teaching of certain subjects, including philosophy and theology (5), were all designed to systemically destroy the abilities of Europeans to think critically. The Prussian educational system codified this system and is the educational system that is still in place in the west today.

The Prussian education system was significantly enhanced after Prussia's defeat in the Napoleonic Wars. The German generals, seeking to create a more obedient and compliant army, and using Luther's Large Catechism as a reference point, devised an education system that would strip soldiers of their critical thinking abilities. This system was designed to produce non-thinking soldiers and workers, rather than independent thinkers. This was achieved through a rigid and authoritarian structure, where teachers acted as authority figures, and students were expected to memorize and regurgitate information without questioning or critical analysis. The classroom then began resembling a church, with a teacher up front resembling a priest, and students resembling congregants obediently listing to a sermon. This system was intentionally designed to suppress critical thinking and creativity, as Luther himself stated, "Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed. Faith must trample underfoot all reason, sense, and understanding, and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and … know nothing but the word of God".

The Prussian Education System in America

The Prussian education system was exported to America in the mid-19th century, primarily through the efforts of Horace Mann, a prominent American educator and politician. Mann was heavily influenced by the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Friedrich Fröbel, and he saw the Prussian system as a model for American education.

In 1843, Mann traveled to Prussia to study the education system, and he was impressed by the efficiency and discipline of the Prussian schools. He saw the system as a way to create a more obedient and compliant population, and he believed that it could be used to promote social cohesion and stability in America.

Mann's efforts to introduce the Prussian system in America was supported by other prominent educators, including Henry Barnard and Calvin Stowe. Together, they worked to establish a network of normal schools, which were designed to train teachers in the Prussian method.

The Prussian system was also promoted by the American industrialist and philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie believed that the system could be used to create a more efficient and productive workforce, and he provided funding for the establishment of schools and teacher training programs.

The American branch of the Prussian system was designed to suppress critical thinking and creativity, and it emphasized obedience, discipline, and standardization. The system was based on the idea that children should be trained to follow rules and authority, rather than to think independently or critically.

Alexander Inglis's 1918 book Principles of Secondary Education breaks down the actual purpose of modern schooling into six basic functions:
 
1) The adjustive or adaptive function. Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can't test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things.\
2) The integrating function. This might well be called "the conformity function," because its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who conform are predictable, and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large labor force.\
3) The diagnostic and directive function. School is meant to determine each student's proper social role. This is done by logging evidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in "your permanent record." Yes, you do have one.\
4) The differentiating function. Once their social role has been "diagnosed," children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step further. So much for making kids their personal best.\
5) The selective function. This refers not to human choice at all but to Darwin's theory of natural selection as applied to what he called "the favored races." In short, the idea is to help things along by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and other punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes. That's what all those little humiliations from first grade onward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain.\
6) The propaedeutic function. The societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor.

That, unfortunately, is the purpose of mandatory public education in the west. To dumb people down, to demoralize them, to divide them from one another, and to discard them if they don't conform. This is why Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton University, said the following to the New York City School Teachers Association in 1909: "We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in every society, to forgo the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks". 

Key figures in the exportation of the Prussian education system to America include:

* Horace Mann: A prominent American educator and politician who traveled to Prussia to study the education system and introduced it to America.
* Henry Barnard: An American educator who worked with Mann to establish a network of normal schools and promote the Prussian system in America.
* Calvin Stowe: An American educator who worked with Mann and Barnard to promote the Prussian system in America.
* Andrew Carnegie: An American industrialist and philanthropist who provided funding for the establishment of schools and teacher training programs in the Prussian method.

Correlations from the Bible:

* "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it" (Proverbs 22:6)
* "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right" (Ephesians 6:1)
* "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God" (Romans 13:1)

References:

* Horace Mann, "Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Board of Education" (1844-1848
* Henry Barnard, "American Journal of Education" (1855-1880)
* Calvin Stowe, "The Prussian System of Education" (1860)
* Andrew Carnegie, "The Gospel of Wealth" (1889)

These functions are still evident in modern education systems, which prioritize obedience, conformity, and standardization over critical thinking and creativity.

Additional facts:

* The Prussian education system was heavily influenced by the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, a Swiss educator who emphasized the importance of obedience and discipline in education.
* The system was also influenced by the ideas of Friedrich Fröbel, a German educator who developed the concept of kindergarten, which emphasized play-based learning and socialization.
* The Prussian education system was adopted by other countries, including the United States, and remains the basis for modern education systems today.
* The system has been criticized for its emphasis on standardization, conformity, and obedience, which can stifle creativity and critical thinking.
