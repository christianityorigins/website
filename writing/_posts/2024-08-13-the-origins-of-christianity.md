Preface
------------------

The central points of this book can be summarized as follows:

-    Elites in antiquity created imperial cult religions to solidify their rule and subjugate the population to their colonial domination. Christianity was one in a long line of slave morality imperial cults invented by these elites. Christianity's progenitors were Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and over a dozen religions from the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt starting with the Serapsis Cult. It is an impossibility that any religion could have sprug up organically. The royal families controlled the publishing and the punishment for spreading a religion that might subvert an imperial cult was death.
-   There existed a Byzantine imperial cult where Julius Caesar took on
    the role of Asander of Bosphorus, and Cleopatra took on the role of
    Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus.
-   The 'Jesus' figure in the bible originates with Julius Caesar,
    I(J)upiter-Zeus (I-Zeus), and became an avatar for several later
    leaders.
-   Sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), Talmudic jews
    who were students of a rabbi named Akiva and who had connections to
    the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt, and who were hiding out in the
    Himyarite Kingdom after Emperor Hadrian expelled them from judea,
    cut-and-pasted from the aformentioned Byzantine-Roman imperial cult
    and repackaged it with two psy-ops: a slave morality for the Romans
    (Christianity), and warrior cult (the blueprint for Islam) to weaponize the Arabs to
    attack eastern Rome (Allah and Muhammad the red-headed warlord were
    eventually added as parodies of Attila the Hun and his uncle Ruglia waging war against
    Rome ("Edom") because the objective was always to weaponize the Arabs to attack eastern Rome).
    Rabbi Akiva created modern Judaism to create ethnocentrism in the
    form of a religion, and his students Markianos of Alexandria aka
    Marcion of Sinope did the slave-morality of Christianity and Simon
    ben Yohai created the warrior-morality of Islam and The Secrects of
    Rabbi Simon ben Yohai.

My research is focused on identifying the people who wrote the bible,
the context in which they wrote it, and my thesis addresses the question
of motive, specifically, who benefited from the invention of
Christianity. My methodologies are multi-faceted: revisionist
historiography, counter-narrative analysis, and historical
deconstruction. The main sources that inspired my research are listed in
the 'further reading' section at the end of the book.

---------------------

-   Alexander (son of King Herod and grandson of Simon Boethus) = Juba
    II who was married to Cleopatra Selene II (daughter of Mark Antony
    and Cleopatra VII) aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Alexander and his
    wife were adopted by Julius Caesar and raised in Rome.
-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod and great-grandson of Simon
    Boethus) = (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka

    father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
    Cleopatros) aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka Alexander the
    Alabarch.
-   Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
    Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia =
    Philo of Alexandria, the sister-wife of Alexander (grandson of King
    Herold). She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary 'Pallas', and
    'Antonia Caenis' who was Vespasian's first cousin and mistress.(See:
    'Following Philo to Pallas (the Freedman): The Most Powerful Man in
    First Century Rome, also known as Goddess (the Mother)' (2019) by
    P.J. Gott

    [[link](https://www.amazon.com/Following-Philo-Pallas-Freedman-Powerful-ebook/dp/B07PXKQGYG/)])
-   Bartholemew ('Bar Ptolemy') = son of Simon Boethus.
-   Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator, Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of
    Egypt = Dynamis Ourania, Queen of Bosphorus.
-   Eleazar ben Boethus = Lazarus of Bethany, son of Simon Boethus.
-   Gamaliel/St. Gamaliel (Paul's teacher) = Tiberius Gemellus, grandson
    of Emperor Tiberius and a cousin of Emperor Caligula. (The Aramaic
    word Gemel means "twin", in Latin it is Gemellus, and in Hebrew it's
    Gamaliel). He was a student of Herod Agrippa who was King Herod's
    grandson (Antiquities of the Jews, Flavius Josephus. Chapter 6).
    Gamaliel was the father of Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben
    Sapphias who was also King Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of
    Adiabene.
-   Gautama Buddha = Gaumata Bardya, son of Cyrus the Great.
-   King Herod = Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV
    of Parthia's regional alias (See: 'Jesus Among the Julio-Claudians' (2017) by Charles N. Pope
    [[link](https://books.google.se/books/about/Jesus_Among_the_Julio_Claudians.html?id=c7A3DwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)]).
- Josephus = Hegesippus.
-   Julius Caesar = Asander, Philocaesar Philoromaios, King of
    Bosphorus.
-   Marcion of Sinope = Markianos of Alexandria. He grew up in the
    Attis-Sabazios cult (i.e. Turkish Judaism) before traveling to Judea
    to study under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the
    Alexandrian School. Professor Revilo P. Oliver claimed that rabbi
    Akiva and his students were the ones who invented Christianity
    (Forgery of Our Own. Revilo P. Oliver,
    http://www.revilo-oliver.com/rpo/Forgery_of_Our_Own.html
    [[link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240720181142/http://www.revilo-oliver.com/rpo/Forgery_of_Our_Own.html)]).
    Rabbi Akiva was the one that came up with the idea that Rome was
    Edom. Rabbi Akiva's other student was rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who
    was the author of *The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai*
    [[link](https://pages.charlotte.edu/john-reeves/research-projects/trajectories-in-near-eastern-apocalyptic/nistarot-secrets-of-r-shimon-b-yohai-2/)].
    Was he also the Roman senator Marcus Pompeius?
- Bishop Ignatius of Antioch = Polycarp (Ignatius means 'fiery one'
    and Polycarp was famous for setting himself on fire).
-   Mariamne Boethus = Mary Magdalene, daughter of Simon Boethus, fifth
    wife of King Herod, mother of Alexander (son of King Herod),
    grandmother of Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and Cleopatra IX
    aka Helene aka "Philo of Alexandria".
-   Mark Antony = King Herod aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV
    of Parthia.
-   Martha Boethus = St. Martha of Bethany, daughter of Simon Boethus
    and she was married to Judean high priest Joshua 'Jesus' ben
    Gamla/Gamaliel who was the son of Gamaliel.
-   Matthias the Apostle = Matthias Boethus, son of Simon Boethus.
-   Emperor Nerva = Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius Piso
    aka Arrius Varus who was the great-great-grandson of Simon Boethus
    and the son of Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his
    sister/wife Cleopatra IX aka Philo of Alexandria.
-   Onias I = heir of the Zadokite (High Priest) dynasty and a direct
    descendant of Joshua the High Priest and Zadok who was a descendant
    of Aaron who was the elder brother of Moses.
-   Onias II = Simeon the Righteous aka Simeon the Just aka Shimon
    HaTzaddik who was the Kohen Gadol High Priest.
-   Onias III = Qumran Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.
    'The Anointed One' which in Hebrew is 'moshiach' and often
    translated as 'messiah'. In Greek, 'The Anointed One' is
    Chréstos/Christ.
-   Paul the Apostle = likely a composite character or an avatar/cipher. Four suspects for having taking on the character are: 1)Gaius Asinius Pollio (who was the
    maternal grandfather? of Vespasian) who raised Caesar Augustus and at
    least five of King Herod's sons, 2)Saulus ben Antipater who was the
    son of Antipater/Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, grandson of King Herod
    (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Chapter 9, section 211),
    great-grandson of Simon Boethus, brother of Costobarus, and adopted
    grandson of Gaius Asinius Pollio, 3)Saulos Thaddeus Alexander
    Herod, another grandson of King Herod, and 4)rabbi Akiva. The character
    Paul/Saul's life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story
    'Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor'. Josephus in Antiquities of the
    Jews, Book XX (CH 9.4) refers to Paul (Saulus) as related to Herod
    Agrippa.
-   Pontius Pilate = several options. The historical record from antiquity has a repeating narrative of jewish high priests being executed by a Roman prefect or governor: Roman Procurator of Judea Lucceius Albinus condeming Jesus ben Ananias to cruxification; Roman Procurator of Judea Quintus Tineius Rufus aka Turnus Rufus the Evil condeming Simon bar Kokhba to cruxification;  Roman prefect (governor) of Roman Egypt Tiberius Julius Alexander condemining Judas the Gaulanite to death; Roman prefect of the Praetorian Guard Marcius Turbo condeming Lukuas Andreas to death; Roman prefect (governor) of Roman Egypt Aulus Avillius Flaccus crucifying many prominant jews in Alexandria, etc. Every one of these characters fit the Pontius Pilate role. I believe that royal elites role-played as if they were characters in a play, and these fictional deaths were story patterns or archetypes that were emulated. They killed off one character then assumed the role of another one in a different location. For example, Aulus Avillius Flaccus was also Polemon II of Pontus which was the regional alias of Emperor Titus. The character of Aulus Avillius Flaccus dies at the same time Polemon II of Pontus takes power and then Polemon II of Pontus dies around the same time Titus becomes emperor. They were all married to the same woman, Berenice, grandaughter of King Herod.
-   Simon Boethus (great-great-great? grandson of Onias III and heir of
    the Zadokite line) = (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus
    aka Simon Magus. Likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the
    Essene sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is
    derived from the Latin 'Pater' meaning "father," denoting the Essene
    High Priest. The Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and
    Simon was the heir of the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). After
    Hellenization many jews adopted Greek names. Matthew became Menelaus
    in honor of the celebrated husband of Helen, etc., so was he
    St. Matthew as well?
-   St. Mark = Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope or Marcus
    Julius Agrippa II, King Herold's grandson.
-   St. Peter = Publius Petronius (father-in-law of emperor Vitellius
    who I identify as Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus
    below).
-   St. Veronica = Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod, wife of
    emperor Titus (Veronica is the Latin alteration of the Greek name
    Berenice).
-   Titus Flavian Clemens = 'Clement of Rome'.
-   Emperor Titus = Aulus Avillius Flaccus, the prefect (governor) of
    Roman Egypt (Egyptian alias), and Polemon II of Pontus. Polemon II
    became the king of Pontius the same year (38AD) that Aulus Avillius
    Flaccus was alleged to have been sent to Ponza island to be killed
    (see: Philo's embassy to Caligula (38CE)). Polemon II of Pontus was
    married to King Herod's granddaughter Berenice who eventually
    married emperor Titus. Berenice was also married to King Herod's
    grandson/Julius Caesar's adopted grandson and her cousin, Herod,
    King of Chalcis. Titus who also Herod, King of Chalcis, the
    great-great-grandson of King Herod (The Royal Ancestry of Emperor
    Vespasian (The Royal Ancestry of Emperor Vespasian. Henry Davis,

    [[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)]).
-   Vespasian = Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King
    Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Great-grandson of King Herod.
-   Vitellius = Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus.
    Great-grandson of King Herod.
-   Zoroaster = Baruch ben Neriah. Scribe of Joshua the High Priest
    (possibly the same person).

Speculative

-   Amenemhept (Adamenemhept) I = Adam (the "first human" in Genesis 1–5)
-   Alexander the Great = Chandragupta (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized
    translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in
    Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). (See: 'Alexander and
    Chandragupta in Sanskrit Drama' by Ranajit Pal

-   James, brother of Jesus = Rabbi Akiva (the name Akiva is related to
    Jacob/James). Theory: Simon of Cyrene was Lukuas Andreas, with his
    "sons" being Julian/John (Simon bar Kochba) and Pappus/James (R.
    Akiva)?

BOOK I. THE ORIGINS OF CHRISTIANITY
----------------------------------------------

### Chapter 1: The Creation of Christianity

Throughout antiquity, from the pharaohs of Egypt to the emperors of
Persia and Rome, religion served as a key instrument of imperial
control, using syncretism to create a compliant population that served
the interests of the ruling elite. These elites used religion, as well
as an incredible number of regional aliases, locations, fictional
stories, and faked deaths for their family members to control the
population. They role-played as deities, religious figures, and
different characters as if they were actors in a play. This was done to hide the fact that the people were ruled by dynasties and to give the population an illusion of upward social mobility or implanting a sense of false hope. These religions were also money making schemes.

The figure of Jesus Christ (of Nazareth) was a literary creation of these elites,
incorporating elements of various historical and mythological figures to
appeal to a wide audience. This character then became an avatar for
several historical figures in an imperial cult.

The development of Christianity can be divided into two phases. The
first phase was the foundation of Christianity as an imperial cult,
while the second phase saw the subversion of this imperial cult by a
group of rabbis (many of whom were connected to the 'Alexandrian School'
in Egypt) who were headed by a Rabbi named Akiva after the Bar Kokhba
revolt (132--136 CE).

#### 1.1 Imperial Cult

There was a Byzantine [^1] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^2] took
on the role of Asander, King of Bosphorus [^3] (the city of Byzantine,
later called Constantinople and now Istanbul was/is located in the area
called Bosphorus), and his wife Cleopatra used the regional alias of
Dynamis Ourania [^4] (translates to 'heavenly power'), queen of Bosporus

![Fig.1.1](/images/caesarasander.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.1. (L) Asander, King of Bosphorus, (R) Julius Caesar 

![Fig.1.2](/images/Cleopatra%20VIIDynamis.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.2. (L) Dynamis, Queen of Bosphorus, (R) Cleopatra VII. There was obviously many years in between the ages that she was depicted, however, even in the elder Dynamis bust you can see her lazy eye and abnormally large eyes which she was reported to have had, possibly as a consequence of inbreeding. 

![Fig.1.3](/images/cleopatra.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.3. (L) Julia Mamaea, Queen of Pontus (wife of Polemon II), (R)
Cleopatra VII. Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus was Julius Caesar/Asander's
regional alias (Asander and Polemon were both married to Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She
would have been married to her half-brother (Cleopatra and Mark Antony's son) Polemon II, King of Pontus
aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom,
also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next
to the Pontus Kingdom

Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who carried the title
'King of Kings'. Her uncle was Mithridates 'Chrestus'[^5].

Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen
(Jesus Amen of Rev. iii. 14) [^6] was married to Stratonice who was the
sister of Asander. He was also a cousin of Dynamis.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Julius Caesar aka Asander = Tiberius
Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios, who was born about the same time as
Caesarion and Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar (Mark Antony = Tiberius Claudius Nero, emperor Tiberius's father, so he likely adopted Julius Caesar/Asander's child).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony [^7](aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander Helios
aka Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his
twin sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is most likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal ('Helio' and Celtic 'Hesus' both derive from the
Proto-Indo-European root 'sawel-', meaning 'sun', and 'Selene'
translates to 'moon' in Greek).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Ptolemy
Philadelphus who was Sampsiceramus I?

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the 'King of Kings') aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria'.

Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister wife Cleopatra (Thea
Philopator) of Mauretania had two sons: Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys aka
Emperor Nerva, and Marcus Julius Alexander aka Yeshua Cleopatros
(Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ma'nu of
Adiabene/Edessa aka Ptolemy aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy aka Izates aka Jesus
Emmanuel aka Monobazus of Adiabene [^8]

![Fig. 1.4](/images/coin-abgar-phraates.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.4. (L) and (R) show King Izates Monobazus of Edessa (known in
Greek as the 'Kingdom of Ourania' or in English as the 'Kingdom of
Heaven') wearing a crown of thorns. Izates or Izas is his title which is
an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning lord. He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image
source: The Alexander Mosaic, Huqoq, Israel.

![Fig.1.5](/images/SauromatesII.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.5. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus, who was the
son of Tiberius Julius Cotys (aka Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius
Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Emperor Nerva), great-grandson of
Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Does he look familiar? Sauromates
is a Greek rendering of "Sarmatian", refering to the Scythian tribe who
came from the Pontic steppe.

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed
above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the "Sons of Ptolemy"), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc. and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee. Judaism is a bastardized
version of Turkish Druidism and the Sabazius cult, filtered through the
Alexandrian School (Plato) with some with some Egyptian (Setianism) and
Babylonian myths thrown in.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^9]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy X Alexander I/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesars life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^10],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^11], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

The Persians effectively used a slave-morality religion as part of their
colonial program (Zoroastrianism and Buddhism), and then the Macedonians
and Romans followed this formula. Religious syncreticism is how they
maintained their empire. The Greeks used a system called 'Interpretatio
Graeca' [^12] to equate their gods with those of other cultures, and the
Romans adopted this system as well ('interpretatio romana').
Christianity was created by scribes at the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt
which was a religion making factory and was overseen by 'Philo of
Alexandria' (Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX
aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka
Julia Ourania of Parthia) as a syncretic slave morality.

It is likely that each Roman emperor after Julius Caesar took on the 'I-Zeus' (Iesus) role as an avatar, which is why I identify many prominent Romans as having contributed to the bible (e.g. Titus Flavian Clemens aka 'Clement of Rome').

Then, after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), this imperial slave-morality cult was subverted by a confederation
of rabbi's who were headed by a rabbi named Akiva.

#### 1.2 The Cult of Antinous and the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE)

During the Bar Kokhba revolt a Rabbi in jerusalem named Akiva ben Joseph
(the name Akiva is related to Jacob/James) who lead the Talmudic
Pharisees and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer
Yetzirah (book of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and
modern judaism, and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle
claimed that he was brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel"
(Acts 22:3)), and who was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome
was Edom", preached that Simon bar Kokhba ('bar Kozeva' = 'son of the
star' in ancient Hebrew) was the 'messiah' during the Bar Kokhba revolt.
Simon bar Kozeva's son was named Rufus which was also the name of the
son of Simon of Cyrene. The Gospel of Mark is about Simon of Cyrene and
Jesus is meant to be seen as an invisible spirit from heaven come down
to accompany Simon and his disciples who then returns after Simon is
crucified.

Two years before the Bar Kokhba revolt emperor Hadrian created a
religion to deify his underage gay lover as the son of god
(Osiris-Antinous) called 'The Cult of Antinous' [^13]. Historian Cassius
Dio claims that Antinous was offered as a human sacrifice to Hadrian
[^14] and later was 'resurrected'. The Cult of Antinous actually rivaled
christianity as the biggest cult in the empire for a couple of
centuries. One of the scribes for this cult was Aquila of Sinope aka
Onkelos who was a kinsman of the Roman emperor Hadrian. The midrash
(Tanhuma. 41a, Mishpatim 3) claims that Onkelos was a nephew of Hadrian
and other jewish sources list him as a nephew of emperor Titus (Tractate Gittin (56b)). Emperor
Hadrian also employed Aquilla of Sinope to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia
Capitolina after the Bar Kokhba revolt (the city was named after Hadrian's family name (Aelia) and the Roman god Jupiter (Capitolina)). Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos was a student of none other
than rabbi Akiva. In Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed
that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul
the Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus"
[^15].

Rabbi Akiva's other students included Markianos of Alexandria aka
Marcion of Sinope and Shimon bar Yochai (Yohai is a nickname for yochai.
The name Yochai means 'YHWAH is gracius' from the Hebrew word Yochanan
sometimes transcribed as Johanan. Was he also Johanan the Alexandrian?
This would place him in Alexandria at the same time as Markianos of
Alexandria) who made the Zohar for Kabbalah and was the author of 'The
Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai' which was the manuscript for Islam.
Allah and Muhammad the reheaded warlord were parodies of Atillia the Hun
and his uncle Ruglia waging war against Rome because they wanted to get
the Arabs to wage war against Eastern Rome [^16]. Another student of
rabbi Akiva was Aristo of Pella, who is a good candidate for being Luke
the Evangelist ('Aristo', or 'Ariston' is a name that is related to
'Proteus' The former means 'first-rank, noble' the second derives from
'first'. So, was he also Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or Mahalia,
sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem was the secretary of Aristo and Marcion is
known to have had a disciple named Lucanus as documented by Tertullian,
so Mark, or Mahalia, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also
Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope?). One other student of
rabbi Akiva was Ketia bar Shalom which was the jewish name of Titus
Flavian Clemens, who was the nephew of emperor Domitian [^17]. Titus
Flavian Clemens is a likely candidate for being 'Clement of Rome'. Rabbi
Akiva's other student was Rabbi Meir who the Talmud (Gittin 56a) claims
was a grandson of emperor Nero, so rabbi Akiva moved in the best society
of the Romans.

'The Secret Gospel of Mark' [^18] which speaks about Jesus's
homosexuality and the Cult of Antinous came out about the same time. It
is possible that the Gospel of Mark was written by Markianos of
Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope for the Cult of Antinous and was
grafted on to the Roman imperial cult, or Markianos of Alexandria aka
Marcion of Sinope and other scribes at the Alexandrian School in Egypt
used the imperial cult as the foundation for the Cult of Antinous and
this became christianity. It is possible that this group was trying to
subvert the imperial cult multiple times before but the Bar Kokhba
revolt was the sign that ideological subversion was the only way to
overthrow the Roman empire. Getting people to abandon their religons for
a new one is an almost impossible task, so instead, through religious
syncrenism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established
religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. So, they just took
one of the imperial cults of the time and infused a slave morality into
it.

This conspiracy was so elaborate that this group even rewrote history to
make it fit with their new religion. Josephus was an alias for
Hegesippus [^19] (the name Hegesippus is most likely a Latin to Greek
corruption of 'Iosippus', the Latinized spelling of Josephus) who was
another person associated with the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt and who was possibly a student of rabbi Akiva. The book 'The Antiquities of the
Jews' was a pseudo-epigraphical work (of propoganda) that was backdated to make christianity look legitimate in the same way that the 'Letter of Aristeas' was backdated to exaggerate the age of the Septuagint. It was historical fiction. I would even hazard a guess that this group was
responsible for burining down the Library of Alexandria which resulted
in the loss of all recorded history up until that point so that they
could cover-up the tracks of their psyop religion which was primarily engineered at the Alexandrian School.

Endnotes (Chapter 1)

(a) I trace the messianic archetype as it appears in the new testament back to two sources: the Saoshynt in Zorastrianism, and Scipio Africanus. Scipio was the first high priest in the Flammen Dialis cult which made him the claimed son of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. His mother was claimed to have been divinely impregnanted by Jupiter. He was also the Salian Priest of Mars, 'second Romulus' (founder of Rome), and Consul of the Republic and Censor. He was the 'messiah' of Rome. He also carried the title I(J)uipter-Ammon (there was no "J" in Latin) to let the Egyptians know that the Roman deity I(J)uipter and the Egyptian deity Ammon were equivalent ('interpretatio graeca'), and likely also carried the title I(J)upiter-Zeus (I-Zeus -> Iesus) to let the Greeks know that I(J)upiter and Zeus were equivalent deities (Roman Jupiter and Greek Zeus both derive from the Aryan skyfather 'Dyeus Pter'. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of Dyeus, and Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter'). Scipio wrote an autobiography that described his "miracles" to improve troop morale. His book was the most popular book in the Roman world and coincidently disappeared around the time Christianity emerged. In 'Chapter 5: Alexander the Great' I write about the similarities of Alexander and the Jesus figure. Alexander did come before Scipio, but everything about Scipio was written before Alexander and therefore it's just as likely that Alexander has been gifted attributes that better belong to Scipio. Julius Caesar modeled himself off of Scipio Africanus, including taking his titles and position as high priest in the Flammen Dialis cult.\
(b) The symbol of the cross, Celtic cross/high cross/sun cross/solar
    wheel, et.al., which predate christianity by thousands of years
    (Callanish Stones. Wikipedia,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones)]), was a
    prominant symbol in ancient Europe. The circle is a sunwheel that
    together with the cross served as a sundial that had markings to
    track the time, date, and lunar and agricultural cycles. Also, in
    portable form it was a sundial clock and compass. Although not a
    religious symbol, as they were astronomical tools, every city in
    ancient Europe would have had a large cross raised at its center in
    the same way that every city today has a clock tower at it's center.
    So you can see how christianity spread throughout Europe, through
    subversion. Most Europeans must have thought that christianity was
    simply the same relgion that they were already worshiping, and
    because of widespread illiteracy at the time, they had no idea what
    garbage was inside the bible.\
(c) The Letter to Flora and the Tripartite Tractate write about a
    Gnostic teacher called "Ptolemy" who I identify as Ptolemy Menneus
    aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus.\
(d) Modern judaism is not the Torah (Old Testament), and has not been
    for a long time. The Talmud was completed after the New Testiment
    and this is what modern jews follow. Essentially, jews follow the
    program that Rabbi Akiva and his students created (ethnocentrisim in
    the form of a religion).\
(e) Kabbalists believe that Rabbi Akiba was a gilgul (reincarnation) of
    Zimri, a prince of the Tribe of Simeon who participated in the
    Heresy of Peor.\
(f) Several members of this Egyptian-Persian-Anatolian-Greek-Roman
    aristocratic family identified themselves as 'jewish' despite being
    ethnically Celtic Gauls or Aryan Sarmatians. Ptolemy (Alexander) bar
    Menneus/Ptolemy X Alexander I (Simon Boethus) played the role of
    judaen high priest. Mark Antony played the role of King Herod.
    Izates of Monobazus (Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben
    Sapphias) and Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia (Jesus ben
    Fabus) played the role of rabbis. Philo of Alexandria was 'Philo the
    Jew', her brother-husband Tiberius Julius Alexander identified as
    Jewish, etc. This could be a case of this family taking on regional
    identities, but the more likely option is that the original redhead clan of Druids that ended up becoming Israelites were Scythians who migrated southwards during the early Aryan invasion of 4000 BC. Scythian --> Saka --> Isaac. This migration coincides with the development of early bronze age civilization. They they went to Anatolia first (Galatia), then Babylon, then Canaan ('Gaulinitis' = Golan Heights). In Canaan, the descendants of the Bablyonian jews then came under the suzerainty of these people and their entire identity, language, and religion
    derives from this. The evidence for this is that the Celtic languages are
    surprisingly Semitic with a verb-subject-object word order and a
    shocking amount of vocabulary overlap, and the name of Irish
    deities, Balor and his holiday Beltaine are cognate to Bal and
    Elatha the Irish Uranus is cognate to Hebrew El. There was apparently an ancient
    conquerer named 'Ram the Druid' and Abraham = Ab Ram, or 'Born of
    Ram', he was also Ra in Egyptian mythology, the basis of the name
    'Ram'esses in Egypt, Ram the Aries, Rama in the Vedas, and Lama in
    Tibet. King David (DWD) = King Druid. The name Israel itself is
    likely named after Osiris (Aesir), the southeasternmost grand Druid (in
    Phoenician, the name "Osiris" is written as "Usr" or "Ysr," which
    becomes the Hebrew "Yisrael. Osiris is depicted as having green skin, ie. he is the 'Druid green man'). As for the name"Jew", the descriptive
    name Judaism was never used by the Hebrews or 'Israelites'; it
    appears only with Christianity. It comes from Yahud or Auda which
    comes from Iodh or Ioux. Iodh and Ioux are associated with the yew
    tree in Druidism and is sometimes linked to the concept of rebirth
    and regeneration. There was also an ancient Celtic tribe known as
    the Iudii or Iudaei, who inhabited the region of Gaul (modern-day
    France) and Britain. The ancient Celtic prefixes 'Rab' or 'Rhab'
    mean 'wise one' or 'seer', and a Druid equates to a Rabbi. The area
    of modern israel was wiped out multiple times. Modern day jews
    evolved from the mixture of Celts, survivors of the Bar
    Kohiba revolt, the proto-Arabs, and high amounts of neanderthal
    admixture from the Crimean peninsula and Cannan (see Chapter 2.1
    Ethnogenesis of the Jews). \

### Chapter 2: The Origins of Judaism

To understand Christianity it is necessary to explain its precursors and
the context in which they were created.

#### 2.1 Ethnogenesis of the Jews

How the jews ended up in Egypt is a matter of contention. One likely
hypothesis is that one part of their ancestry followed the path of the
Hyksos who were Scythian Aryan raiders that hailed from the
Pontic-Caspian Steppes (modern day Ukraine). The domestication of the
horse and invention of the chariot allowed them to travel great
distances. 'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the
Scythians by the ancient Akkadians (Josephus. Vol. 5: Antiquities:
8:2:5, pp. 593-595). The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and
the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew,
the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the
Gimirri (known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks). The Cimmerians
weren't a race but rather a tribe (Cimmerian likely derives from the Old
Iranic Gayamira, meaning "union of clans, or Gāmīra or Gmīra,
meaning"mobile unit") [^20].

In Egypt, the jews carried the name 'Habiru' (translates to dust, dirt,
outcastes in ancient Egyptian) and they were documented to be slaves by
the Greek-Egyptian historian Manetho in his book Aegyptica.

The Hyksos managed to become kings of Egypt for a period of time during
the 15th Dynasty. The Hyksos pharaoh took the name "Apepi", referring to
the Egyptian equivalent of the devil [^21], and created a religion based
around the worship of Set, the Egyptian god of violence and destruction
("Setianism" is where "Satanism" derives from). "King Apophis, L.P.H.,
adopted Seth for himself as lord, and he refused to serve any god that
was in the entire land except Seth.." -- Papyrus Sallier I, ca. 1274
BCE. The 15th Dynasty also corresponds to the Second Intermediate Period
which was when Egypt saw a large influx of foreigners and a demographic
transformation [^22].

The Hyskos were eventually expelled by the 18th dynasty pharaoh Thutmose
III in 1457 BC and they then moved to Canaan (modern day Israel)
(Josephus. Contra Apion I.90). The Crimean peninsula and Canaan were the
last bastions of the Neanderthals and there was lot of human-neanderthal
mixing that happened in Cannan [^23]. This is why the Ashkenazi jews
have paternal Steppe haplotypes today (R1a and J1 most commonly) and why
they are obsessed with matrilineal descent (Neanderthal males could not
create offspring with homo sapien sapiens, but homo sapien sapiens could
impregnate Neanderthal females [^24]).

#### 2.2 The Creation of Judaism

It was in Jerusalem (then located in Canaan) where the jews synchronized
Canaanite Baal/Baal-zebub (the tetragrammaton YWHA is another word for
Baal which translates to "lord", ie. Baal-zebub = "lord of the flies".
See: 'Strong's Concordance reference' #H1180.) into their satan
('setian') worshiping religion. This religion they created was extremely
blood thirsty with their tribal war god YWHA demanding the child
sacrifice of the first born sons, with them being burned alive [^25].

The Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, then conquered Judah in 597
BC which led to the deportation of Jews (586 BCE) and many of them moving
to Babylon. The Babylonians found human child sacrifice abhorrent and
this is what led to the Babylonians destroying Solomon's Temple and the
jews rewriting the Old Testament to retcon their entire history with
Sumerian and Babylonian creation myths to ingratiate themselves to the
Babylonians (the flood story is stolen from the Epic of Gilgamesh, the
creation story is stolen from the Enuma Elish, the Moses story is stolen
from the Legend of Sargon, the Adam and Eve story was stolen from Enki
and Ninhursag, their code of laws was stolen from King Ur Tablets). They
also started offering their savage god just foreskins instead of the
full baby as a sacrifice, although they have been continually accused of
the ritual murder of gentile babies since then [^26].

In 539 BCE Cyrus the Great conquered Babylonia and soon afterwords afforded the jews special protection including allowing them to move to Persia. It was then in Persia where Jeremiah and Baruch ben Neriah (who were probably the same person) then codified the first draft of judaism. Baruch ben Neriah also worked for Cyrus as a scribe for an imperial cult that became Zoroastrianism.

Then a few centuries later around 283-246 BCE Ptolemy I Soter summoned 72 Babylonian Jewish high priests (kohanim) to Alexandria to translate the Hebrew Bible. It was in Alexandria where they wrote the Pentateuch and Septuagint. See: Chapter 7. The Alexandrian School. These jewish high priests opened up some books at the Library of Alexandria and cut-and-pasted Greek philosophy into their religion. The myth of the jewish people and the Laws of Moses was based on Plato’s hypothetical colony of Magnesia from his thesis called The Laws (347 BC) in which the proposed charter for the Cretan colony of Magnesia was modeled in large part on Athenian legal and constitutional traditions. Ancestor received law from a deity, hereditary priesthood rather than king, as well as the division into 12 tribes were all part of the formula. Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) is where the story of Abraham comes from. Plato's Timaeus is also the source for Genesis 1-11. Homer's Odysseey was the source of Genesis 24, 42-46 (Gmirkin, Russell (2016). Plato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible). Exodus is just a semitized retcon of Jason and the Argonauts, and the Oracles Against the Nations plagiarize the Sibylline Oracles. The fact that their religion was extremely Hellenized in Alexandria shows that they were trying to ingratiate themselves into the Greek speaking world (oecumene).

The Pentateuch was written at the same time as the Septuagint in Alexandria. Judaism was built upon an oral tradition that was laid down by Jeremiah and Baruch ben Neriah.

The authors/compilers of the Pentateuch and Septuagint in Alexandria included Onias I (see: Chapter 7: The Alexandrian School). They created judaism as one of the earliest psyops ever created and it was used to control the social behavior of other jews and to promote ethnocentrism in the form of a religion. While in Alexandria, at the same time they created this tribal group strategy religion for their in-group, they worked as scribes and created several slave morality religions for the out-group, including the Serapis Cult, which was the progenitor of every slave morality that followed.

### Chapter 3: The Origins of Zoroastrianism

Zoroaster was Baruch ben Neriah [^27] who was a member of the priestly
caste of jews in Babylonia who created Zoroastrianism as a slave
morality system in order to subvert the people of the Iranian Plateau.
The subversion was done as revenge on the Babylonians for the
destruction of Solomon's Temple and the deportation of Jews (586 BC) and
despite the last king of Babylon, Nabonidus, treating the jews well
[^28]. Very shortly after its foundation in 550 BC the Persian Empire
under Cyrus the Great aka Koroush Kabir (Koroush = "lord of the sun",
"kabi = great. Cyrus translates to Kurosh in ancient Persian) wiped the
Babylonians out, and allowed the Jews to return to Canaan (539 BC).
Through the Edict of Cyrus the jews were then allowed to have their own
autonomous province called Yehud Medinata and also build their Second
Temple (Ezra 6:14), beginning Second Temple Judaism. Obviously, this
happened due to the extreme influence of Zoroastrianism, a Jewish
creation, which Cyrus promoted.

All the troubling aspects of christianity originate in Zoroastrianism:
monotheistic deity that judges you when you die, eternal hell,
universalism, sin/salvation, confession of sins, self-deification to
weaponize/empower the lowest castes. Zoroastrianism also has a religious
commandment called 'Xwedodah' that commands Zoroastrians to marry and
procreate with their siblings, with punishment for not doing so!

#### 3.1 Zoroaster and Jewish Influence

Zoroastrianism would go on to influence every slave morality religion
that came later, including Buddhism and every one that came from the
Alexandrian School in Egypt, which was a Hellenic school to pump out
even more slave morality fiction to control the masses.

(a) Baruch ben Neriah's grandfather was named 'Ma'aseiah'/Hoshaiah
    (Jeremiah 32:12-16), the 'king's son' (also the Prophet Isaiah?
    'Ma'aseiah'/Hoshaiah could be alternate versions of Isaiah. Also,
    was Hoshaiah also Jeshua son of Je-Zedek (Zadok III)? Hoshaiah and
    Jeshua both mean "Yahweh is salvation.") who was probably one of the
    sons of king Ahaz aka Jehoahaz II (Jehoahaz is close to
    Jehoshua/Jesus) who was killed by Zichri in the invasion of Judah by
    Pekah, king of Israel (2 Chr. 28:7). King Ahez is recorded to have
    burned his children alive at the Valley of Hinnom
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna)] (The King James
    Version of the Bible translates Gehinnom with the Anglo-Saxon word
    hell). Four of Ma'aseiah'/Hoshaiah's sons were: Azariah, Zedekiah,
    Zephaniah and Neriah. Baruch's grandmother must have been the
    biblical Jezebel. The Gospel of Matthew lists Ahaz of Judah in the
    genealogy of Jesus. Baruch's brother, Seraiah ben Neriah, was the
    chief chamberlain (R.V.) to Zedekiah. According to the Old Latin
    Version of the Apocryphal Book of Baruch (i. 1) he was of the tribe
    of Simeon.\
(b) In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus "The Anointed One" which in
    Hebrew is "moshiach", often translated as "messiah". In Greek "The
    Anointed One" is Chréstos/Christ or Soter. "This prophet, Cyrus,
    through whom were to be redeemed His chosen people, whom he would
    glorify before all the world, was the promised Messiah, 'the
    shepherd of Yhwh' (xliv. 28, xlv. 1)."\
(c) Zarathustra likely derives from the Hebrew word "Zerah" which means
    "rise", or it's related Hebrew word Zara which means "growing seed"
    (see below for more on this word). Another connection is that
    "Jeremiah" in Arabic is Armiah which correlates to Zoroaster's
    supposed native place called Urmiah. The texts the 'Apocalypse of
    Baruch'
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Baruch)] and
    the 'Rest of the Words of Baruch'
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_of_the_Words_of_Baruch)]
    hint at Jeremiah and Baruch being the same person (Jeremiah's
    "visions" are described by Baruch in the first person).\
(d) Interestingly, Cyrus the Great's successor Darius the Great's full
    name was Darayavahu. Yavahu is uncommonly like Yehouah (YHWH). Vahu
    is the Iranian god of the wind, that became, like the Hebrew, to
    mean breath and so life, so Yavahu literally means the same as YHWH.
    Scholars admit the etymology of "DR" ("ZR") is puzzling. [In
    Aramaiac and Iranian the d and the z could interchange, e.g. Manda=
    Manasseh]. Literally, "zara" refers to the action of sowing seed in
    the fields (Gen 26:12; Isa 37:30), and seems to be a Semitic root.
    So, Zara in Hebrew is seed, and Darayavahu can be read in Hebrew
    meaning "seed (progeny) of Yehouah," "seed of the living god.". In
    the Book of Daniel and the Book of Esther 2:1-23 it is claimed that
    Darius's son Xerxes I (Ahasuerus) was the grandson of Ahasuerus and
    his jewish wife Esther who was a descendant of Israel (Jacob)
    through Benjamin, Kish and Shimei. Josephus, Antiquities of the
    Jews, Book XI, Chapter 6, repeats the same claim. Also, the Sefer
    HaYashar (Book of the Righteous) claims that Darius the Great was a
    descendant of King Saul through his daughter Merav. Persia became
    multicultural after Darius. Darius the Great was also the one who
    wiped out the Scythians during his Scythian campaigns [^29].\
(e) Darius the Great's grandson Artaxerxes I had a jewish cup-bearer
    named Nehemiah (Neh 2:1) who must have come form a royal family and
    thus was a descendant of Baruch ben Neriah. This shows how close
    Baruch ben Neriah's family was to the Persian aristocracy.

### Chapter 4: The Origins of Buddhism

Gautama Buddha was Gaumata Bardya the son of Cyrus the Great who was the
one who spread Zoroastrianism. The Persepolis Tablets (PFS 79, PFS 796
and PF 250) which date from the time of Darius the Great are filled with
Buddhist iconography and tell a story that Darius the Great came to
power by overthrowing the "stargazer-Magus" Gaumata in Babylon. Gaumata
Bardya was the satrap (governor) of the Persian province of Bactra
(modern day Afghanistan).

Buddhism is a philosophy and religion that is focused on escaping
suffering. Central to this belief is the Four Noble Truths, which
explain the cause of suffering (desire) and the path to ending it
(enlightenment through the Eightfold Path). Buddhism is clearly a
slave-morality that is designed to turn its followers into pacifists and
submissives and obviously benefited Gaumata Bardya and/or the
Greco-Bactrians that ruled Bactria.

#### 4.1 Buddhism's Roots in Zoroastrianism

Symbolism, beliefs, and themes that originate in Zoroastrianism show up
in Buddhism. For example, Ahura Mazda has also been called Buddha Mazda,
specifically in Afghanistan where Buddhism was a major religion [^30].
There are also numerous overlapping customs, such as spiritual
initiation, vegetarianism, and the use of fire in worship. Both
religions also share similar prayer practices and ceremonies, such as
the veneration of ancestors and purification rituals.

4.2 The Hellenization of Buddhism

After its inception, Buddhism was further influenced and spread by the
Greco-Bactrians. Pyrrho of Elis, who traveled to India with Alexander
the Great, created Bactrian Buddhism [^31]. This form of Buddhism was
further developed in Alexandria and later through Ashoka the Great's
syncretic efforts in India.

### Chapter 5: Alexander the Great

Alexander the Great was an archetype for the Jesus figure. The jews
declared him a messiah, or "The Anointed One" (Chréstos/Soter)
(Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b) because he "liberated"
them from the Persians in 330 BC. Paradoxically, the Jews did the same
with Cyrus the Great when he in turn "liberated" them from the
Babylonians. The Jews also told Alexander the Great that the book of
Daniel was a prophecy about him (it wasn't, they wrote it after they met
him). The Book of Daniel "prophesied" of Alexander the Great of Greece
conquering the whole world even Israel. He was called the Ram of God by
Prophet Daniel and in Daniel 8:5-7 a male goat with a large horn between
his eyes suddenly arises from the west and smashes both horns of the
ram. The angel Gabriel tells Daniel this goat represents the kingdom of
Greece and its large horn is its first king,

#### 5.1 Alexander's Influence on Religious Thought

YHWH = Jehova = Jove (Yoweh is similar to Latin Iove) = Jupiter =
Ye-Zeus (YHWH + Zeus). Alexander claimed to be the son of Zeus
(Zeus-Amun, Zeus-Ahura Mazda, Zeus-Yahweh, etc.).

![Fig.
1.6](/images/Alexander.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.6. Alexander the Great as Zeus Ammon (or Jupiter Ammon), the ram
god. The Greeks had identified the Egyptian god Ammon with Zeus, the
Romans identified Ammon with Jupiter.

#### 5.2 Alexander as a Prototype for the Jesus Figure

Other similarities: according to the first-century A.D. historian
Plutarch, Alexander's mother Olympias told her son that he had been
conceived when a thunderbolt -- interpreted as Zeus -- entered her womb,
so he was divinely birthed. He died at 33. 'The Son of the Man' is a
Koine->Aramaic->Koine mistranslation of Alexander and he was the "King
of Kings" [^32].

Endnotes (Chapter 5)

(a) Alexander indirectly became the Jesus prototype. Julius Caesar
    called himself the Roman Alexander and stole a lot of Alexander's
    mythology for his religion called the Divine Julius Cult which was
    plagiarized to make Christianity more appealing to the Romans. See:
    Chapter 9. Rome.\
(b) A non-mainstream version of history, but one that is recorded in
    Persian and Islamic sources [^33], is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince (Bupares) who was the son of Kai Bahman (Artaxerxes
    II Memnon), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon' [^34]
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'. He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta (Alexander is Iksander in Persian and
    "Alakshandra" in Sanskrit and Gupta means 'guardian' or 'protector'
    in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). Evidence of this is
    that the Sanskrit language might be a dialect of Avestan, or a
    Hellenized variant of Avestan, and the similarities of customs and
    religions [^35]. Also, there is strong evidence that Alexander's
    successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, ruled India with the
    regional identity of Ashoka the Great [^36]. See: Alexander Romance
    [^37], The life of Alexander of Macedon [^38], and Alexander the
    Great: Beyond the Divide by Charles N. Pope [^39].\
(c) Alexander is also identified as the Islamic prophet Dhu al-Qurnayn
    (He of Two Horns). His name comes from coins depicting him as Zeus
    Ammon, a two-horned pagan god (see: Fig 1.3.).

### Chapter 6: Ancient India

#### 6.1 The Asuras and Jewish Influence

The earliest mention of the jews being in India is in the Indian
religions. They were the Asuras [^40] who were described as power
seeking demons [^41]. They probably moved east after the Assyrian
expulsion in 733/2 BCE. Then, several centuries later in the 3rd century
BC, Aristotle, quoting his pupil Clearchus who traveled to India, and
recorded in Josephus's Contra Apion, wrote that there were jewish
"priests" and "philosophers" in India in the 3rd century BC: "Jews are
derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians
Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their name from the country
they inhabit, which is called Judea.". Megasthenes (350 BC - 290 BC)
recorded the same thing: "the Jews were an Indian tribe or sect called
Kalani".

#### 6.2 The Aryan Invasion and the Evolution of Indian Religions

The Indus Valley civilization was founded by Neolithic (Med) people from
Iran (Harappan civilization). They mixed with R1a haplotyped Aryan
invaders from the Pontic Caspian Steppes [^42] who brought the Sanskrit
language and the ancient Vedas. Was it through the Scythian connection
that the jews moved into India? Or Cyrus the Great or his son Gaumata?
Or Alexander the Great? After Alexander, the jews had a Judean based
Qahal that stretched into Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Did it
stretch into India as well?

The Aryan invasion around 1500 BCE introduced new cultural and religious
ideas into the Indian subcontinent, leading to a blending of indigenous
beliefs with those of the incoming Aryans. This period saw the
foundation of Vedic texts, which were heavily influenced by the existing
cultural practices, including those brought by Jewish settlers.

The interactions between these groups led to a rich tapestry of beliefs,
with the Vedic tradition incorporating elements of Jewish thought,
particularly regarding morality and the nature of the divine. The
emergence of Hinduism was influenced by these syncretic processes, which
created a complex religious landscape characterized by myriad deities
and philosophical schools.

Endnotes (Chapter 6)

(a) A few authors have claimed that the Dravidians were Ethiopians that
    the jews imported to India via South India and Sri Lanka to work as
    slaves in the spice trade and in the marble mines (also to create
    tribal conflict with the Aryans). Importing them in large numbers
    from the south meant that they went undetected by the Aryans in the
    north. From Ethiopia it is a straight line route to Sri Lanka via
    boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves then mixed with indigenous Australoid/Denisovans
    who were similar to Australian Aborigines.\

    which explains how Babylonian jews were involved in the slave trade
    since the 6th century BC, even reaching India. An interesting fact
    is that the Radhanite, who owned the Silk Road trade, were their
    descendants. These Radhanite/Babylonian jewish slave traders would
    eventually go on to dominate the white slave trade of Eastern Europe
    and they were the ones who founded Khazaria in Eastern Europe as
    their base of operations (see: 'A Theory of Khazars and Ashkenazi
    Jews' by Pierre Simon. Occidental Observer. February 8, 2024). Their
    descendants went on to start/control the transatlantic slave
    trade. \
(c) Calami is a village located in the Kannur district of Kerala,
    southwest India. Kochi, also known as Cochin, is a major port city
    in the state of Kerala. Cochin is obviously phonetically related to
    the name Cohen (Kohanim/of the priestly Zadokite line).\
(d) "*it may be said that the region from Tigris-Euphrates to the Indus
    and its east was inhabited by the Akkadian speaking Semites who
    later called themselves as Asshuraiu. Their Indian name as known
    from Rgveda is *'*Asura*'" -- '*The Languages of Harappans*' by
    Maliti J. Shendge. In Aramaic the word Ashura means "tenth"
    referring to the tenth day of the month/Yom Kippur, the Day of
    Atonement.

### Chapter 7: The Alexandrian School

#### 7.1 The Role of the Alexandrian School in Religious Syncretism

Alexander the Great's successors ("Diadochi") were Seleucus I Nicator
who controlled a large chunk of the eastern territories, including
Mesopotamia and Persia, Diodotus I Soter who controlled Bactria
(possibly also India under the alias Ashoka the Great), and Ptolemy I
Soter who controlled Egypt. Following in the tradition of Alexander the
Great (Ptolemaic Cult of Alexander [^43]), the Seleucids (Mithraism
which was Zoroastrianism + slave morality), and the Bactrians
(Buddhism), Ptolemy I Soter created his own slave morality religion
called the Serapis Christus cult [^44] which was meant to bridge the gap
between the Greek and Egyptian cultures and subjugate the foreign
Egyptian people to his rule. This new god, Serapis, combined aspects of
Egyptian deities like Osiris and Apis  (Serapis = Osiris + Apis =
Osir-Apis = Ser-Apis) with Greek gods like Zeus, and had an Egyptian
body and Greek head.

#### 7.2 The Creation of the Septuagint and Its Impact

According to the Letter of Aristeas [^45] Ptolemy I Soter summoned 72
Babylonian Jewish high priests (kohanim) to Alexandria to translate the
Hebrew Bible. It was in Alexandria were these jewish priests wrote the
Pentateuch and Septuagint [^404]. It is possible to identify who some
of these jewish high priests were, and they were the descendants of the
Zadokite jewish high priests who created Zoroastrianism. Moreover, their
descendants were the ones who created Christianity.

In the book The Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus, Book XX, Chapter 10
[^46] he writes that Onias I was the leader of the Babylonian jews who
went to Egypt. Onias I was the heir of the Zadokite (High Priest)
dynasty that traces back to Joshua the High Priest. Baruch ben Neriah
was the scribe for Joshua and in the Old Latin Version of the Apocryphal
Book of Baruch (i. 1) it says that Baruch was of the tribe of Simeon
(same as Onias I). These Babylonian jews settled in an area of Egypt
that they called the 'Land of Onias' [^47] where they created a
sacrifice cult at the 'Temple of Onias' [46](#sdfootnote46sym). Josephus
also writes that Onias I was a friend of Alexander the Great
(Antiquities, Book. 8, section 7) and later Ptolemaic kings
(Antiquities, Book. 13, section 69) and it was through this connection
that this family not only were able to acquire land and protection but
eventually became aristocrats who married into the Ptolemaic dynasty
(Onias I was also the jewish high priest who tried to convince the
Spartan king Areus I that the Spartans were jews and promoted an
Abrahamic-Herculean syncretic religion to them [^48]).

The son of Onias I, Simeon the Righteous (aka Simeon the Just aka Shimon
HaTzaddik --  HaTzaddik ("the righteous one") obviously comes from Zadok
("righteous")), was the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) of Israel and one of
the last remnants of the Men of the Great Assembly [^49]. The Talmud
(Yoma 69a) claims that Alexander the Great "prostrated himself at the
feet of Simeon the Righteous". Then, to flatter Alexander, Simon the
Righteous named every son of jewish priests (kohanim) born that year
Alexander [^50]. Also, like Cyrus the Great, Alexander the Great was
declared a messiah, or "The Anointed One" (Chréstos/Soter) [^51] because
he "liberated" the jews from the Persians.

The son of Simeon the Righteous was Onias III, who was also an "Anointed
One" as prince according to Daniel Ch 9:25. Onias III was probably also
the Qumran Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The descendant and heir of Onias III, and the heir to the Zadok high
priest line, was Simon Boethus (great-great-great grandson of Onias III?
[^52]) aka Simon Magus [^53] aka Ptolemy Bar Mennius (Menelaus was the
name of the mythical founder of Sparta and this family adopted his name
[i](#sdendnote1sym), and "Ptolemy" signifies that this family had
intermarried with the Ptolemaic royal family by this point) who was the
creator of Gnosticism.

After the creation of the Serapis cult, the Alexandrian School then made
an industry out of taking existing religions and then adding to them a
psy-op slave-morality foundation. Manichaeanism, Valentinianism,
Buddhism [^54] Hermeticism (Philo of Alexandria's syncretic philosophy
to Hellenize the Canaanite religion of the Levant), and christianity
(slave morality targeted to Rome) all came from this school. The
Sibylline Oracles were a style guide for their students [^55].

Alexander the Great's Egyptian heir Ptolemy I Soter apparently shared
Alexander's esteem for the jews. According to Josephus (Antiquities,
Book. 12, chapters. 1, 2, pp. 308-309), and The Letter of Aristeas,
12,19, it is recorded that after Ptolemy I Soter took Judea he brought
120,000 Jewish captives to Egypt from the areas of Judea, Jerusalem,
Samaria, and Mount Gerizim. "Soter" in ancient Greek is similar to
Christios, i.e. "anointed one". Was he proclaimed a Christ and Messiah
by the jews like Cyrus and Alexander? Ptolemy I Soter's descendants also
obviously had a positive view of the jews because by Roman times the
Jews constituted 40% of the population of Alexandria [^56], and members
of this priestly jewish family carried Ptolemaic royal names.

Endnotes (Chapter 7)

(a) "Alexander had 'planted' a colony of Jews who had increased in
    number until at the beginning of the Christian era they occupied
    two-fifths of the city and held some of the highest offices." ...
    "With its character largely determined by Jewish elements" --
    Encyclopedia Britannica article on the Alexandrian School (1911)

(b) Manetho in his book 'Aegyptiaca' wrote that the Hyksos or Habiru
    were lead by a priest named Osarseph and that Osarseph = Moses.
    Interestingly, Osarseph also = Ahmose Sipair or Serapis. The "Si"
    symbol in Si-pair, ie. "son of", is really "Ser". Also, pharaoh
    Thutmose who expelled jews to Jerusalem has been proposed as
    "Moses". Was the Serapis Cult invented by the same family of jewish
    high priests who invented Zoroastrianism as a way of connecting the
    Egyptian people to them and flattering Thutmose III and then was
    later retconned for Ptolemy Soter?

### Chapter 8: The Origins of Gnosticism

Platonism was the school of thought that started with Plato's teachings
and mixed Aristotle, Socrates, and Pythagoras into it. Neo-Platonism was
popular with the Roman elite. This is why Jews (especially in Alexandria
Egypt) wanted to infiltrate and subvert it with Gnosticism. 

#### 8.1 Simon Magus and the Creation of Gnosticism

Simon Boethius, a Jewish high priest and heir of the Zadokite dynasty
and a descendant of Joshua the High Priest, Baruch ben Neriah, and Onais
I, was Simon Magus who was the creator of Gnosticism ("gnosis", or
hidden knowledge) [^57]. The name Magus comes from Magi ("Simon the
Magi"), which was the name of the proto-Zoroastrian priests who
worshiped the evil brother Angra Mainyu more than the good brother
Ahura-Mazda, which comes from the twin-brothers Vedic gods Varuna-Mitra.
The theological bridge between Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism was likely
Manichaeanism or Mandaeism in which Simon was the prophet Mani in both
religions. Like Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism, Manichaeanism and
Mandaeism feature a dualistic worldview, but Manichaeism emphasizes
escaping the material world through knowledge ("gnosis") and good works,
and Mandaeans believe in one God of Light and revere John the Baptist.
Zurvanism, which was a determinist sect of Zoroastrianism, could be
another link between Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism. Unlike
Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism sees Zurvan, the god of infinite time, as the
ultimate source giving birth to twins Ahura-Mazda (good) and Angra
Mainyu (evil), just like the Demiurge in Gnosticism. This challenged
Zoroastrianism's free will concept, suggesting fate was predetermined.
Fundamental to both Zurvanism and Gnosticism is a dualistic view of the
world, with a good and evil force in constant conflict.

The central belief in Gnosticism is that god and life are evil and that
gnostic followers should not reproduce. It is an antinatalist suicide
cult to get the Greeks and Romans to reduce their populations while
raising them in a slave morality at the same time.

Simon was also Ptolemy Menneus [^58] and he was married to the Hasmonean
Princess Elizabeth of Jerusalem, Queen Alexandra II [^59] and his
daughter was Mariamne Boethus aka Alexandra Salome aka Mary Salome aka
Helena Of Adiabene [^60] (Helene was philologically interchangeable with
Selene and from there Salome) who was the fifth wife of King Herod.
Ptolemy Menneus was also Ma'nu II of Oshroene/Adiabene [^61].

Simon had a couple Gnostic sects that worshiped him: the Simonians
[^62], and a religion called Sophia [^63]. He was also likely the
prophet Mani in Manichaeanism and Mandaeism. The Nassenes [^64], who
were one of the earliest Gnostic sects, attributed divinity to Simon's
daughter Mariamne Boethus aka Mary Magdalene in xtianity [^65]. Simon's
other daughter Martha = St. Martha of Bethany who was married to Judean
high priest Joshua 'Jesus' ben Gamla/Gamaliel who was the son of
Gamaliel [^66] ("Paul the Apostle" claimed that he was brought up in
Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)) who was a grandson of
Hillel the Elder [^67] which would also connect Simon to the Mishnah and
the Talmud. Lazarus of Bethany = Eleazar ben Boethus, Simon's son,
another son was Bartholemew ("Bar Ptolemy"), and Matthias the Apostle =
Matthias Boethus, his brother. His great-grandson Saulos Thaddeus
Alexander Herod [^68] = Paul the Apostle? and his great-great
grandchildren Berenice = Saint Veronica (Veronica is the Latin
alteration of the Greek name Berenice) and Marcus Julius Agrippa II =
Marcus/Mark.

#### 8.2 Gnosticism's Influence on Early Christianity

Simon's line of descent to focus on is through his grandson Alexander
(son of King Herod) aka Juba II ("Iuba" is most likely a diminutive of
Iehuva, but "Iuba" also translates to "love" in the Berber languages of
Mauretania that he was king of exactly like "Philo" translates to "love"
in ancient Greek) who was Simon's grandson through his daughter Mariamne
Boethus [^69]. Alexander (son of King Herod) was married to Cleopatra
Selene II (daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII) aka Queen Thea
Muse Ourania. Alexander (son of King Herod) and Cleopatra Selene II were
both adopted by Julius Caesar and were raised in Rome (Julius Caesar and
Augustus adopted heirs of many royal families and got them to intermarry
because then every Roman client state would be ruled by a single family
and they would then be easier to control through proxy)).

Fig 1.7. (L) Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II. (R) Cleopatra
Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania

Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II had
two prominent children who were married to each other:

-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod) [^70] aka Gaius Julius Alexander,
    Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the
    Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch)
    Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka
    'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's father in the Talmud;
    Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or Cleopatros) aka Phraates
    IV (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of Adiabene. Alexander
    (grandson of King Herod) had over a dozen aliases [^71] and he was
    the richest man in the world at the time. Note how 'The Son of the
    Man' is a Koine->Aramaic->Koine mistranslation of Alexander and
    that as the grandson and heir of King Herod he was the 'King of
    Judea', 'King of the Jews'. Also, through his mother he was a
    descendant of the Egyptian Pharaohs, hence 'Son of God' [^72] as all
    Egyptian Pharaohs were called that. Like his ancestor Onias III and
    his adopted grandfather Julius Caesar Alexander (grandson of King
    Herod) used the title "Chrestus" ("anointed one") [^73]. He is also
    Jesus in the bible. He was married to his sister (see below).
-   Philo Judaeus of Alexandria ("Julius Philo", of the Julia gens
    [^74], because she was the adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar),
    which was an alias for King Herod's granddaughter (Salome III?) aka
    Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
    Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka
    Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Theophilus in the bible. She was also
    'Pallas' (as in the ancient Greek goddess 'Pallas-Athena' who in
    mythology frequently disguised herself as a man) [^75] who was
    Claudius and Nero's secretary, and 'Antonia Caenis' ('Caenis' was
    the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man), who was
    Vespasian's mistress [^76]

Endnotes (Chapter 8)

(a) Theory: Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania was also the Roman general 'Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo'. Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo conquered Armenia alongside Tiberius Julius Alexander (his son Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys aka Emperor Nerva), after which, Tigranes VI (Tiberius Julius Alexander) was instilled as king. Compare his bust [link] to the famous 'Josephus' (Tiberius Julius Alexander) bust [link]. Notice a resemblance? If this is correct, then he (Alexander) would have been the brother-in-law to Caligula and father-in-law to Domitian. Tiridates of Armenia (who would have been Mithridates Chrestus' great-great-grandson) was the one who spread the religion Mithraism which was a syncretic a slave-morality religion to subjugate the Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It’s a solar son deity, a Jupiter. 

### Chapter 9: Rome

Christianity is the combination of several religions and myths that were
amalgamated. The Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great, Serapis cult,
Roman imprial cult, Gnosticism, the Roman myth of Quirinus aka Romulus
[^77], the Divine Julius cult [^78], and the messianic archetypes of
Alexander the Great and Scipio Africanus [^79] who most ancient Roman
leaders, but especially Julius Caesar, modelled themselves after.

![Fig.1.9](/images/Denarius_C._Memmius_C._F._Romulus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.9. Romulus. He was born to a virgin, the son of god, hailed as a
King, crucified [^80] by a conniving elite and rose from the dead. See:
'Romulus' (75AC) by Plutarch.

#### 9.1 The Role of the Herodians in Rome

King Herod was the likely regional alias of Mark Antony (aka Tiberius
Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) [^81] and his descendants were
given an elevated position within Rome. They were raised in the same
household as Caesar Augustus [^82] and even became emperors.

Herodians in Rome to take note of:

Alexander (grandson of King Herod), who was the richest man in the world
at the time, and his sister wife Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka "Philo of
Alexandria" had two prominent sons:

-   Marcus Julius Alexander aka Gaius Calpernius Piso aka Izates bar
    Monobazus (aka Pliny the Elder?).
-   Tiberius Julius Alexander (Tiberius Julius Alexander's son was named
    'Philopappos' and one of his mothers recorded maiden aliases was
    'Alexandria bat Matthias' [^83] which is where the pseudonym 'Joseph
    bar Matthias' comes from. Also, drop the initial b and final s in
    the name "Bar Mathias" and you get (Joseph of) Arimathea) aka Arrius
    Calpernius Piso [^84] and Arrius comes from "Arrius Varus" [^85],
    one of his many alias, which in turn is probably a diminutive of his
    uncle's name Aristobulus) aka Emperor Nerva [^86].

![Fig.
1.10](/images/Josephus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.10. Erroneously identified 'Josephus' bust which I identify as
Tiberius Julius Alexander. Compare it to Nerva's depictions

Emperor Vespasian was another likely grandson of King Herod. He was
Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, son of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV
who was Julius Caesar's adopted son [^87] (ignore the elder busts of him
which have idealized Julio-Claudian features and look at his youngest
depictions [^88]. Vespasian was his title, not his name (Vas/Bas was the
royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pasius
= Peace. 'Vespasian' = 'King Peace'). He was also 'Flavius Scaevinus'
the conspirator who was involved in Nero's assassination. 'Philo of
Alexandria' aka Salome III was also 'Antonia Caenis' who was Vespasian's
first cousin and mistress and her son Tiberius Julius Alexander was
Vespasian's son-in-law/adopted son and the Prefect (leader) of the
Praetorian Guard which made him arguably the most powerful man in the
empire during Vespasian's reign. Philo of Alexandria aka Salome III was
also the first cousin and ex-mother-in-law to King Herod's granddaughter
Berenice aka St. Veronica (Veronica is a transliteration of the Greek
name Berenike meaning 'victory') who was empress of Rome through her
relationship with Vespasian's son Titus. Berenice's brother, Marcus
Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an incestuous relationship with [^89]
before moving on to her cousin, was the governor of all foreign Roman
territories except Egypt (which was governed by Tiberius Julius
Alexander) during the Flavian period..

![Fig.
1.11](/images/Vespasian.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.11. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesars adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister). He abdicated his position in favor of his younger brother.

So, five emperors in a row were King Herod's grandsons or
great-grandsons: Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva.

![Fig.
1.12](/images/emperors.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.12. Note how the Roman emperor phenotype changes dramatically
after Otho

Every Roman Emperor from Hadrian (likely an acronym for Herodian [^90]
onward descends from King Herod mainly through two women: Arria the
Younger and Cleopatra of Mauretania or Cleopatra IX ("Philo"), and by my
count 37 Roman and Byzantine emperors bore the title "Flavius" and it's
later Greek->Latin transliteration "Phlabios" ("Shabbos").

Fig. 1.13. (L) Constantius Chlorus. The father of emperor Constantine
(R) Emperor Flavius Constantine/Constantinus who carried the Flavian
title.

The origins of Christianity become clear when you realize that the
Herodians, Alexandrian elites, and the Flavians were the same incestuous
[^91] family who used over a dozen aliases, agnomens, regional/ethnic
names, and different biographies and mythologies for each persona [^92].

9.2. Alexandria, Egypt. 1st Century

Emperor Caligula and his Prefect of Roman Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus
(the real-life Pontius Pilate) [^93], most likely became aware sometime
around the Alexandrian Riots in 38CE that jews in Alexandria, in
conjunction with the Alexandrian School, were trying to usurp the Romans
through a revolution that weaponized the slaves and lowest classes. He
then killed Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II and imprisoned his
son Alexander (grandson of King Herod). This led to Philo's embassy to
Rome in 40CE [^94]. This family then used their connections in Rome and
money to bribe the Praetorian Guard to kill Caligula as revenge. Both of
Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in
Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately
became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's
death and eventually succeeded Aulus Avilius Flaccus as the Prefect of
Roman Egypt. This group achieved their coup when Vespasian became
emperor.

A stylometric and textual analysis can trace the earliest [^95] Koine
Greek written [^96] New Testament epistles back to the Alexandrian
School in Egypt and Philo of Alexandria, but the actual conspiracy to
use a slave morality religion to destroy civilizations traces back to a
group of jewish high priests in Babylon and their slave morality system
successfully took down the mighty civilizations and races of Babylon,
Persia, Egypt, India, Rome, and eventually, all of Europe.

Endnotes (Chapter 9)

(a) Note on Vespasian's rise to power. Alexander (grandson of King
    Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander were personally
    responsible for the overthrow of Caligula [link], Nero, Galba,
    Otho, and they paved the way for Vespasian's accession as the
    founder of the Flavian dynasty
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Alexander#:~:text=While%20Prefect%20of%20Egypt%20(66–69)%2C%20he%20employed%20his%20legions%20against%20the%20Alexandrian%20Jews%20in%20a%20brutal%20response%20to%20ethnic%20violence%2C%20and%20was%20instrumental%20in%20the%20Emperor%20Vespasian%27s%20rise%20to%20power.%20In%2070%2C%20he%20participated%20in%20the%20Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20as%20Titus%27%20second-in-command.)].
    Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in
    Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately
    became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's
    death. Before his death Nero is quoted as saying that followers of
    Chretus started the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD) (Tacitus, Annals XV.
    44). The burning of Rome was part of the coup to install the
    crypto-jewish Flavian family into power. Vespasian, going by the
    alias 'Flavius Scaevinus', was directly involved in this conspiracy
    to overthrow Nero and burn Rome. Also, in July 69 CE Alexander
    (grandson of King Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander
    declared their allegiance to Vespasian and persuaded their legions
    to follow him. This was a crucial move that gave Vespasian a strong
    base of support in the eastern part of the empire. Tiberius Julius
    Alexander also sent money and troops to Vespasian's allies in Italy
    and Africa and helped to secure the loyalty of other provinces and
    governors. Essentially, they used social engineering, bribery, and a
    slave morality religion to overthrow Rome, then, like in Egypt under
    the Hyksos and Babylonia and Persia under Cyrus the Great, they
    flooded Rome with foreigners to destroy group cohesion and cause
    tribal conflict with them ruling over the chaos.

APPENDICES

Appendix A

How did christianity spread? Vespasian and his sons Titus and Domitian
brought 100,000 jewish "slaves" to Rome (Josephus, Jewish War vi, 9)
[^97]. It seems likely that the 100,000 jewish "slaves" joined the jews
that were already in Rome and they became the early church missionaries
and profited from selling this religion to the slaves and exploited
classes.

Appendix B

The jews were expelled at least three times from Rome after being
accused of missionary efforts/co-opting Roman religions and making them
jewish [^98]. In 139 BC they were expelled by Gnaeus Cornelius Hispanus
for "corrupting the cult of"Jupiter Sabazius". They were then expelled
in 19 AD by Tiberius, and in 41 AD by Claudius. Claudius in his letter
of warning to the Jews in Egypt (preserved in a papyrus in the British
Museum, P. Lond. 1912) described them as"the fomenters of a universal
plague.".

    [[link](https://www.unz.com/article/how-fake-is-roman-antiquity/)]
    for a few authors who make the claim that the "first Rome" was based
    out of Anatolia. I subscribe to this theory as well. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. Also, the word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called 'Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn' ('Kingdom of the Romans'), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the 'new History' that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    --Sir Isaac Newton, in his book 'The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended' (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand. Anatoly Fomenko also makes several other controversial
    claims in his work, specifically that Charlemagne was not a real
    person, but one of the phantom individuals Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same person.
    The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic Plague (it's
    a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed "Dark Ages") is
    exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. Also, the 'first
    Rome' was based out of Anatolia, in an area that is modern Istanbul.
    The last point I independently confirmed. Julius Caesar = Asander of
    Bosphorus, and all early Christianity traces back to to the
    Bosphorus.

[^2]: Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to
    the Indo-Aryan word for 'king' and Julius (Iulius) is similar to
    both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for 'sun'). Julius Caesar
    was deified in two religions: in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is
    related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which
    made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (There was no letter J in
    Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both
    derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky
    Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus', and
    (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter' ->
    Diespiter -> Iupiter), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus
    Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented,
    Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was
    put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high
    priest) in his religion. \

    His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod, Mithridates Chrestus descendant?) after Rome's defeat of Parthia around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate the Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant carried the title Monobazus aka Manu-Sabazios). The Mithras cult has many similarities to Christianity; Mithras was born of a virgin, Mithras' birth was celebrated on December 25, Mithras was considered a savior and redeemer, etc., although all these traits are 'de jure' of saviors in ancient religions, probably because they all came from the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism, Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and many other religions came from the Alexandrian School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint for these religions./

[^7]: The name Herod likely derives from the amalgamation of Horus and
    Hercules. Mark Antony claimed descent from Hercules and declared
    himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became king of judaea around the time of Mark Antony's "suicide". This is typical for these elites, they would kill off one character and then assume another one in a different location as if they were actors in a play\

    by Montague Rhodes James: "In Solomon of Basrah's Book of the Bee
    (ed. E. A. W. Budge, 1886: c. xxxvii. p. 81) we read,"The Prophecy
    of Zaradosht concerning our Lord. This Zaradosht is Baruch the
    scribe." The prophecy is uttered to the disciples of Zaradosht, the
    King Gushnasp (Hystaspes) and Sasan and Mahmad. The Virgin-birth,
    crucifixion, descent into hell, resurrection, ascension, and second
    coming are predicted, and in answer to a question of Gushnasp,
    Zaradosht says, "He shall descend from my family. I am he and he is
    I; he is in me and I am in him."

[^53]: Simon was also "Simon the Essene" the founder of the Essene sect
    and "Simon Peter" in the bible? The term "Peter" is derived from the
    Latin "Pater" meaning "father," denoting the Essene High Priest. The
    Essenes called themselves "the Sons of Zadok" and Simon was the heir
    of the Zadokite (High Priest) dynasty. One of Simon's sons used the
    title Zadok as his name (Josephus: Antiquities 18:1:1). Sadduc
    (Sadducean) and Zadok are the same word rendered respectively the
    Greek way and the Hebrew way in our alphabet. The Sons of Zadok are
    a family of priests (kohanim) that descended from Zadok and are the
    upper echelons of Judean society. Also, Ha-Simeon = Hasmoneans. The
    Kohanim were entrusted with carrying the Torah and other jewish
    writings and their status transferred from father to son. --The name
    "Simon" probably denoted that he was of the tribe of Simon/Simeon
    --In Hebrew, the house of Onias is "Beit Honniyah". --The name
    "Boethus" is a misrecorded name from oral tradition. It was Bayztus
    originally, or bar YZT or bar Izates. YZT being the original Aramaic
    and Izates a Greek sounding variant. It meant "Yakov zu Tolomy" or
    Jacob aka Ptolemy. --https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_Flora

    Gnostic teacher called "Ptolemy" who I identify as Ptolemy Menneus
    aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus).

    killed by his father Herod, but this is obviously untrue. Josephus

    claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [link].
    Alexander (son of King Herod) was executed by Caligula (probably for
    spreading the psyop religion) --Alexander (son of King Herod) aka
    Juba II was also "Monobazus" who was the king of the Parthian client
    state of Adiabene in the 20s and 30s of the 1st century AD. This is
    why the Muslims refer to jesus as "Isa" or "Iza" and in the Yazadi

    --Matrilineally, Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister
    wife "Philo" descend from Mark Antony and Cleopatra. The Talmud says
    that Mark Antony was born to a jewish mother. His first wife Fulva
    was jewish, and Cleopatra was a Ptolemaic ruler and her family had a
    long history of intermarriage with Jews, so this family was almost
    fully jewish. The bust attributed to Mark Antony that is housed in
    the Vatican Museum was made over a century after he died during the
    Flavian dynasty. This: https://imgur.com/7RnVvRv is the only bust
    that is believed to have been made during his lifetime. --Alexander
    (grandson of King Herod) was the controller of the Egyptian gold
    mines, shipping ports and warehouses, at least 1/3 of the imperial
    Roman revenue went through him. He was also the administrator for
    the extensive land estates in Egypt owned by his aunt Antonia Minor
    (Emperor Claudius's wife, Emperor Augustus niece, and she was Mark
    Anthony's youngest daughter) (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 19.276).
