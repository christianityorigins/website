Christianity as a Slave Morality Religion and its Modern Secularized Variants: A Jewish Conspiracy and Hoax on the Gentiles

By Hugo Pepe

_"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household"_ -- Matthew 10:34-36

Preface

Every single species on earth works towards the preservation and strengthening of its bloodline, from bonobos to pin oaks to jellyfish. Every single one. It is only through the domesticating forces of universal religions (Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam) that man has been able to 'overcome' these natural and deep biological drives and act in ways that are neutral or actually harm the reproductive success of his genes and offspring. Because of these universalizing religions, western man is an animal in the process of domestication. \
        The first part of this book explains how the Christian slave morality works and is heavily dependent upon the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, and the second part explains how Leftism and Marxism are Christianity's atheist-compatible sects.  \
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Essentially, the christian slave morality system is designed to transvaluate a groups ethnic values so that the weak, debased, and traitorous become the nobility. Weaponizing the outcastes is how the system gains power and becomes self-regulating, and is why it is such a powerful divide-and-conquer Trojan Horse religion. 
        

  

Chapter 1. The Christian System
  
Christianity is a sophisticated divide-and-conquer millenarianist (1) slave morality (2) system that is packaged as a religion. The system works by weaponizing the lowest "chandala" (3) (outcastes and untouchables in the Hindu caste system) of society (4) to attack and overthrow the aristocratic and warrior castes; and secondly, the christian system contains within it a pacifist slave morality system that is designed to transvaluate a groups aristocratic and warrior values while turning these aristocratic and warrior castes into obedient and submissive slaves.  
  
1.1. Monotheism

  

The collectivization of divine authority reinforces a universal morality. Everything becomes collectivized with the centralization of power. This makes a group easier to control. \
        Monotheism traces back to the slave morality of Zoroastrianism at the time when Cyrus the Great assumes total power of Persia, and in Rome as the Roman Republic turns into the Roman Empire headed by a singular dictator, Julius Caesar.  

  

1.2. Universalism

  

Christian universalism derives from monotheism. The universalization of a group into a singular monolith not only allows a group to become top-down controlled, but it also becomes a tool of empowerment for the oppressed. Friedrich Nietzsche believed that the universalistic claims of Christianity allowed the lower classes, or "chandala" as he called them, to feel equal to the higher classes. By emphasizing a shared humanity and a common destiny in the afterlife, Christianity undermined traditional social hierarchies based on intelligence, wealth, or power.  
        Christian universalism also led to ethnic erasure. The catholic church deliberately destroyed ethnic customs and beliefs to emphasize the universality of Christianity. Pre-Christian Europe was a patchwork of ethnicities, each with its own gods and traditions and christianity deliberately destroyed these ethnic bonds so that a religious identity replaced an ethnic identity. "Christendom" then became the first universalized identity that was built around a shared morality that transcended ethnic and cultural boundaries. "Christendom" was then replaced by the word "European" after the enlightenment, but that label still retained Christendom's universal nature. "European" like "Christendom" is a state and political identity, opposed to an ethnic or national identity, and the adoption of this universalist identity destroyed what little of specific ethnic European customs and traditions that were left. 

  

1.3. Nietzschean 'Transvaluation of Values' 

  

Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the "transvaluation of values" is central to understanding how Christianity reshaped societal norms. This theory states that traditional christian values, which emphasize humility, selflessness, guilt and pity, were created to undermine the strong. Essentially, by redefining "good" as virtues of the "chandala", i.e., by replacing a groups aristocratic values with "chandala" values: guilt, pity, self-hate, weakness, and vulgarity replace strength, pride, honor, loyalty, family, race, and tradition, etc., essentially through vilifying the powerful the lowest "chandala" castes can become the nobility. This leads to a culture that celebrates mediocrity while demonizing excellence.

  

1.4. Nietzschean 'Ressentiment' (Weaponizing the "Chandala" Castes)
  
Universalism, the transvaluation of traditional ethnic values, monotheism (good vs. evil), and the concept of sin exist to self-deify and weaponize the lowest castes. This is why Friedrich Nietzsche called christiantiy and it's secularized variant of leftism "slave-moralities", because it allowed the slaves to feel morally and socially superior to the higher castes because of the concept of sin and set commandments of behavior.
\
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       In his book 'On the Genealogy of Morality' (1887) Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that the jews (5), who he claimed are motivated by deep resentment and hatred (6), create these "slave morality" systems (7) to empower the lowest "chandala" castes (8). This is what makes the system self-policing and self-regulating. The savior complex (9) is a subset of christian self-deification and is a heritage of monotheism and messianism (10). Self-deification (11) is the foundation for attacking those that are identified as heretics (12) and redeeming others.

1.5. Control Mechanisms  

While Christianity empowers the 'chandala' caste through universalism and the 'transvaluation of values', thereby elevating them to a position of authority over the aristocratic and warrior castes, it also functions as a system of domestication. This system is designed to instill fear, self-loathing, and a loss of autonomy in its adherents, while fostering feelings of guilt, shame, and intellectual apathy. By discouraging critical thinking and intellectual curiosity, which are seen as threats to faith, Christianity can create a culture that devalues learning and promotes a mentality of subservience (this is the reason why every Christian white trash town is filled with people whose culture is built around a contempt for learning) (13). Furthermore, this system can lead to a disconnection from one's ancestral heritage and genetic identity. Ultimately, it seeks to create a population that is obedient and submissive, with a subconscious affinity for Jewish culture. It does this through:

  

*   Fear and punishment/trauma based mind-control programming: the concept of "hell" that they plagiarized from Plato's Republic (the 'Myth of Er' (14)); the lifelong fear of death (Pagans equated death with glory). Also, reward. The concept of "heaven" for asceticism/suffering/obedience.
*   Circumcision: children enduring the excruciating pain of circumcision immediately after birth instills a permanent psychological impact that predisposes one to fear and anxiety. 
*   Omniscient god: the concept of a self-existant god who can read your thoughts and judge your behavior becomes a behavior regulating mechanism.
*   Emphasis on Suffering: Christian narratives focus on the suffering of Christ and the martyrs which glorifies weakness and passivity making it seem more virtuous to endure suffering than to overcome it. This is a way for the the oppressed to find validation in their hardships.
*   Group polarization (15).
*   Guilt and shame: Instilling guilt and shame complexes from birth and then offering a program of "salvation" to cleanse you of that guilt and shame (through working against your own tribal and familial interests). Christians are brainwashed into believing that they are sinners (there are dozens of types) and that they were born with Original Sin (sin you inherit from simply being born).
*   Humility, self-denial, and ascetic ideal: Christianity exalts humility and self-denial as virtues. These values encourage individuals to reject their innate desires for power and achievement. By promoting meekness and self-abnegation, Christianity suppresses the natural inclination to assert oneself and strive for greatness. This leads to a passive and submissive attitude, undermining one's potential for growth and excellence. This is designed to suppress the "will to power" and control the masses.
*   Moral absolutism: The insistence on absolute moral truths fosters a binary worldview, reducing complex human experiences into simplistic categories of good and evil. This moral absolutism undermines the individual's ability to navigate ethical dilemmas through personal judgment.
*   Learned helplessness: no matter how enslaved and exploited you are you shouldn't resist because a savior will eventually come rescue you if you pray hard enough, and if a savior doesn't come, you will be rewarded when you die.
*   Penance: Evangelism and missionary work as part of a program of salvation that will expiate your guilt. Evangelism makes the psyop self-perpetuating.
*   Prayer: The purpose of prayer is to reinforce the brainwashing (guilt, shame, fear) by continually repeating directed affirmations.
*   Confession: To further reinforce the guilt and shame complexes by continually confessing guilt. Confession also creates a religious commandment that turns its followers into informants, exposes traitors to the church or state, exposes rebellions, and makes the system self-regulating. 

Themes and symbols that parallel an animal being domesticated also fill the bible. For example, the concept of "sheep" and "shepherds"; In the New Testament, Jesus often refers to himself as a shepherd (e.g., John 10:11, Matthew 9:36) and his followers as sheep. This language reinforces the idea of a hierarchical relationship, where the shepherd guides and controls the behavior of the flock, much like a domesticated animal might be managed by its owner. The idea of "training" and "discipline"; In the New Testament, Jesus and his apostles often use language related to training and discipline (e.g., Hebrews 12:11, 1 Corinthians 9:27). This can be seen as a parallel to the process of domesticating an animal, where the animal is trained to obey commands and respond to stimuli in a predictable way. The concept of "submission" and "obedience"; Throughout the New Testament, followers of Jesus are encouraged to submit to his authority and obey his teachings (e.g., Matthew 7:21, John 14:15). This can be seen as a form of behavioral conditioning, where individuals are taught to associate certain behaviors with reward or punishment, much like a domesticated animal might be trained. The idea of "being transformed"; In the New Testament, followers of Jesus are encouraged to undergo a transformation, becoming "new creations" (2 Corinthians 5:17) and putting on a "new self" (Ephesians 4:24). This can be seen as a parallel to the process of domesticating an animal, where the animal's behavior and nature are altered through training and conditioning. "I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience" (Romans 15:18) - Paul the Apostle. \
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a clever divide-and-conquer strategy. Build a coalition of the outcastes of society and then weaponize them to attack the warrior and aristocratic castes while simultaneously transvaluating their aristocratic cultural values to subvert them. This was the formula that was used in Rome, the French Revolution \[[link](https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution)\], Revolutions of 1848 \[[link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615300)\], Russian Revolution \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution)\], and attempted in the German Revolution \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919)\]. Each of these revolutions empowered and weaponized the outcastes of society with a unifying slave-morality ideology (Marxism/Bolshevism/Leftism are simply secular variants of christianity). \
        This system was also integral to European colonialism. Before the colonial powers sent the military they sent the missionaries. Through christianity, they weaponized the outcastes to fight the warrior castes. Then, christianity placated the native populations by preventing any rebellion (the lowest outcastes self-policed the warrior castes who had their warrior values "transvaluated" and the population eventually succumbed to the thought that they would be rewarded when they die if they submitted).

Chapter 2. Secularization of Christianity
  
As well as Christianity being a slave-morality system, Fredrich Nietzsche wrote that Liberalism is a secularized Christian political-theological religion (16). The Reformation coincided with the invention of the Gutenberg printing press which increased literacy and this is when a myriad of Protestant sects sprung forth: the Anabaptists, the Mennonites, the Amish, the Digger Movement, the Ranters, etc., all of whom adhered to a system of communism and preached about universalism and a utopia on earth. Marxism was one of these sects. The only difference is that Marxism was the first secularized Christian sect where the belief in a supernatural god was replaced with a belief in an omnipresent government. 

  
Chapter 3. Marxism is Secularized Christianity  

_Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat."_ Marx and Engels, ‘Manifesto of the Communist Party’, Selected Works, Volume 1, p 56.
  
Marxism is a secularized Christian sect that replaces god with the government. The central organizing principle of classical Marxist economics, “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”, was lifted verbatim from the pages of the New Testament. Marx's historical materialism (theory of history) is the eschatological framework of Christian orthodoxy in secularized form. Christian salvation is Marxian emancipation. Also, Marxism is built on the philosophy of liberation and universalism (17) and preys on the impoverished and outcastes of society by promising them a future utopia through the triumph of the proletariat. Marxism, like christianity, is also dogmatic and sectarian; both justify violence as a catalyst for social change; both prohibit private property; "take from the rich to give to the poor", and "may the last be first", etc. If you strip away the Marxian narrative you will see that at its core it is the exact same christian divide-and-conquer population control system that is designed to weaponize the resentment of the lower classes for the overthrow of society. This is not a coincidence. Influenced by his teacher Bruno Bauer who wrote extensively about how Leftism was a secular christian cult, Karl Marx approached a Christian communist group called the 'League of the Just' (18) and got them to finance him while he came up with an atheist-compatible sect of christianity.  
  
3.1 Marxist Denominations

  

Marxism is a secularized sect of Christianity that sees class as the main cause for inequality. Critical Theory is a Marxist sect that replaces class with culture as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Cultural Marxism"). Critical Race Theory is a Marxist sect that replaces class with race as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Race Marxism"), and Third Wave Feminism is a Marxist sect that replaces class with gender as the main cause of inequality (i.e., "Gender Marxism"). There is overlap between these Marxist sects, and this is called "intersectionality" in academia. For example, feminists teach that class, culture, race and gender all combined (usually encapsulated through "White") are the structural causes of inequality. \
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       In the 1960s, the 'New Left' social movement, conceived by former students of the Frankfurt School, is when the lefts focus on individual liberty and economics was replaced with identity politics and social justice (cultural marxism). But the conditions that allowed for this movement to grow were already present in the culture with roots in christianity.

  

3.2 Secular Christian Tenets and Ethics

  

Marxism, Critical Theory, Critical Race Theory, Leftism/Wokeism all incorporate the same ethics, metaphors, symbols and meanings that originate in Christianty.

  

*   White guilt/privilege/fragility/et.al. = Christian Original Sin.
*   Monotheism = the binary opposition between good and evil (left vs. right). A singular truth in Christianity (one God, one truth) mirrors the left's ideological stance where there's often a clear delineation of right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, progressive vs. regressive. The moral superiority that white leftists often claim is rooted in this dualistic worldview.
*   White saviorism = Messianism: The idea of white people as moral saviors or messianic figures echoes religious concepts of a redeemer or savior. Many white leftists see themselves as engaging in a divine mission to eradicate racism or save or redeem non-white people.
*   Social activism = Christian mission. The cultural exportation of "Western values" where "whiteness" is the new gospel.
*   Virtue signaling = Christian penance.
*   Publicly exhibiting self-hate/self-flagellating = christian piety signaling. In christianity, genuflection, self-abasement, and self-abnegation are necessary prerequisites for spiritual purity and cleansing. This is expressed as "mortification of the flesh". For 2000 years, Europeans have been rewarded for piety signaling, i.e., displaying self-hate, confession, self-flagellation, etc., and punished for not displaying these things. This is also a form of narcissistic self-sacrifice that is inspired by a suffering servant deity.
*   Salvation/atonement (through accepting jesus and admitting sin) = accepting Leftism and admitting privilege.
*   "Whiteness" = Christian Universalism ("Christendom"). The idea that self-identifying as "white" makes one a representative, spokesperson, or judge of the behavior of the entire group aligns with universalist ideologies where a single entity or belief system is seen as encompassing all humanity. "White" is downstream from the universalist christian identity of "christendom".
*   Race/IQ/gender/genetics denialism ("Boasian anthropology") = "all equal in Jesus".
*   Political Correctness = Heresy.
*   Cancel culture = witch-hunts/excommunicated for heresy.
*   Adopting labels and slogans (pronouns, BLM, trans ally, etc.) = bearing the mark, or taking up the cross. This is equivalent to wearing a cross or crucifix as a visible sign of one's faith and signaling to others that they are a member of the community. They gain social capital in progressive circles through this. 
*   Government = God. An omnipresent entitlement and benefactor giver.

What is the end goal of these divide-and-conquer slave-morality systems? (Christianity/Marxism/Cultural Marxism/Race Marxism/Gender Marxism). "Progress" (deconstruction/abolition) is the weaponizing the poor, outcastes, racial groups and women to get them to overthrow the dominant group in society and then create a slave class controlled by a tiny elite. Why? Friedrich Nietzsche claimed that all these slave-moralities were the manifestations of a Jewish group strategy/essentialist racial instincts operating below the level of real consciousness \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#Jews,_nationalism_and_European_identity)\].

Chapter 4. Judaism vs. Christianity: What do the Jews Believe?

  

Around the same time that jews at the Alexandrian School in Egypt created the New Testament to mentally subvert their enemies, they plagiarized Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) (where the story of Abraham comes from), Plato's The Laws (347 BC) (19), Manetho’s Aegyptiaca (ca. 285–280 BC) (where the story of Exodus comes from), and Berossus’s Babyloniaca (278 BC) and then turned this new religion into a group strategy that created an intense ethnocentrism, an unconquerable will to power, and a drive to exist at all costs (20).  
  

You can prove that Christianity is a slave morality system that is designed to subvert a group simply by comparing the differences between the Old and New Testaments (21)  
  

*   Jews: "eye for an eye" and "never forgive, never forget". Christians: "turn the other cheek" and "submit to the evil doer".
*   Jews: "life should be endowed with material worth." Jews do not believe in an afterlife and believe in achieving riches and pleasure in this life. Christians believe in asceticism and that they will be rewarded in the afterlife.
*   Jews: the Torah contains over 100 mitzvot concerning business and money-making. Christians: "usury" and money lending is one of the worst sins.
*   Jews: master race/"God's chosen people", outbreeding or conversion is forbidden. Christians: Universalist/"all are one in Jesus", "love thy brother". Having "pride" is one of the worst sins.
*   Jews: multiple mitzvots that command them to be fruitful and have as many kids as possible. Christians: the bible preaches celibacy \[too many verses to quote, so go here: link\] and antinatalism (Ecclesiastes 4:3, Job 3:16, Matthew 26:24), and moreover, "jesus" even says that men should castrate themselves to gain entry into the kingdom of heaven! (Matthew 19:11-12 \[link\])
*   The “New Testament” was built on Judaism, which unconsciously ties Christians to Jewish masters.
*   Judaism is tribal. Christianity is universal.
*   Judaism is an ethnocentric religion that does not accept converts. Christians actively seek converts of all races because Christian Universalism considers everyone equal.
*   The Old Testament is filled with hatred, violence, killing, and war. The New Testament is filled with love, unconditional tolerance, and anti-rebellion: "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword".
*   Jews loath Christians, but Christians believe that Jews are "God's chosen" and they exist to serve Israel.

Chapter 5. Conclusion

  
As Friedrich Nietzsche keenly observed, almost all of the persons who think they have freed themselves from Christianity disdain its creed but love its poison. The 'herd' will always think in binary terms; good and evil, true and false, conservative and progressive. That there could be a completely different way of thinking would never occur to the masses. All of their patterns of perception, logic, symbol formation, thought, speech, action, and emotional response have evolved to operate subconsciously within the dynamics of this system. This system stripped them of identity, pride, tribal spirit, vril, and the will to power with the ultimate goal of turning them into a guilt-ridden and self-loathing slaves.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took 2000 years of domestication to reach the point where Europeans would sacrifice their nations and the future of their children on the altar of equality, but the seeds for this was inculcated through this system. \
   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is horrifying to think of the scale that this psyop grew to, how this system became institutionalized, how it changed the evolutionary group strategy of billions of people, how it created hell on earth for the entire planet for centuries, and how it is the system that is responsible for the needless destruction of billions of people.

Addendum

My critique of leftism was not coming from a conservative perspective. Leftism is a secularized variant of protestantism (puritanism), but conservatism is secularized catholicism with its focus on hierarcy and tradtion. Western left vs. right politics is a relict of abrahamic monotheism.

Friedrich Nietzsche claimed that slave moralities \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality)\] (xtianity, Buddhism, liberalism, etc.) allowed the chandala castes to triumph over the aristocratic and warrior castes in ancient India and in Rome and he predicted that they would eventually allow them to overtake the entire west which is what you see today \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man)\]. Ex. the lowest scum chandala are empowered to destroy all progress in their attempt to gain moral and social supremacy over the higher castes.

Quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche:  
\--"Christianity, sprung from Jewish roots and comprehensible only as a growth on this soil, represents the counter-movement to any morality of breeding, of race, privilege:—it is the anti-Aryan religion par excellence. Christianity, the revaluation of all Aryan values, the victory of chandala values, the gospel preached to the poor and base, the general revolt of all the downtrodden, the wretched, the failures, the less favored, against race: the undying chandala hatred as the religion of love".  
\--"The Jews are responsible for bringing mankind to a state where it finds it ever harder to affirm life at all: they have made mankind sick with their reversal of values, whereby only those who suffer are good, only those who are poor, those who are despised are good; only those who deny life are good."  
\--"Christianity aims at mastering beasts of prey; its modus operandi is to make them sick— weakening is the Christian recipe for taming, for “civilizing.” Buddhism is a religion for the closing, over-wearied stages of civilization".  
\--Friedrich Nietzsche was a major influence on every jewish philosopher and on every jewish intellectual movement over the past 100 years \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzschean_Zionism)\] \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_and_reception_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#Early_20th-century_thinkers)\] \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction#Influence_of_Nietzsche)\]. It is almost as if groups like the Frankfurt School read what Nietzsche warned about and then turned around and promoted those things instead.

21\. Marcion of Sinope was a theologian who rejected the Hebrew Bible and the God of the Old Testament. The Marcionites taught that the Jews really were "the synagogue of Satan". He denied that Jesus had been a Jew, and saw that it was preposterous to claim that an incarnate god could die or would foolishly have himself crucified. Marcion of Sinope = Markianos of Alexandria, a jewish student of Rabbi Akiva. This was a cleaver ruse to repulse the jews from adopting the psy-op. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: "Was it not a necessary feature of a truly brilliant politics of vengeance, a far-sighted, subterranean, slowly and carefully planned vengeance, that Israel had to deny its true instrument publicly and nail him to the cross like a mortal enemy, so that the whole world might naively swallow the bait?".  Ie. Nietzsche saw that successful promotion of Christianity depended on a pretence of reciprocal hostility between Christians and Jews. Adding anti-semitic passages to the bible could also be seen as a way to seperate the jewishness from it. Karl Marx published 'On the Jewish Question' immediately before the 'The Communist Manifesto' presumably for the same purpose. \
--Christianity has other inbuilt mechanisms to prevent jews from converting. Ex. Calling jews the "synagogue of Satan"; Jesus disobeys the strict dietary laws of the Jewish religion by picking ears of corn on the Sabbath when work is forbidden, eats with unwashed hands and with publicans and sinners. "Love thy neighbor" including the despised Samaritans. Also, the main weapon to repulse jews from Christianity was the Talmud, written after the Bible had been compiled in which the Rabbis preached hatred against Christians.
