1 Pythagoreanism

Pythagoreanism is a philosophical and spiritual tradition based on the teachings of Pythagoras, which posits that the ultimate reality is a unified, all-encompassing, and eternal monad, often referred to as the "One" or the "Unity". This monad is the source of all existence, and the universe is seen as a harmonious and interconnected system, governed by mathematical laws and principles, with the numbers and proportions being the fundamental building blocks of reality.

There are only three things that you need to know to understand Pythagoreanism:

1.1 Cosmology

The cosmology of Pythagoreanism is monism \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)\]. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter (1)). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality.

1.2 Beliefs

Monist cosmology posits that all phenomena reduces to one principle and the universe is composed of a single fundamental substance. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in monist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

1.3 Rituals and Practices

Rituals: In monist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, rituals like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are used to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and is aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality.

Practices: The study of mathematics and music was essential to Pythagoras's teaching. He believed that mathematics was a way to access the underlying structure and harmony of the universe. By studying mathematics, the individual could gain insight into the fundamental principles and patterns that govern reality. Music was seen as a way to access the emotional and spiritual dimensions of human experience. By studying music, the individual could gain insight into the nature of harmony and balance, and could develop a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the universe. Music was also seen as a way to cultivate the emotions and to develop a sense of inner peace and tranquility.

1\. There are different types of monism: materialistic monists believe that everything is made of matter, and even things like thoughts or consciousness are just products of physical processes. Physicalist monism is a variant of materialistic monism where everything is ultimately physical or dependent on physical states. This view aligns with atheism. Idealistic monism is the opposite, where everything is fundamentally mental or spiritual, and the physical world is a manifestation of mind or consciousness. Neutral monism posits that there's a single substance or principle from which both mind and matter arise, but it's neither purely mental nor purely physical. Pantheistic monism posits that the universe, nature, or the cosmos itself is identical with the divine or God. Ancient European religions were Dharmic (non-dogmatic), so the cosmology was always left up to the follower. This is also seen in Vedism, and this is why monism has the broadest appeal; atheists, theists, polytheists, et.al., can find meaning in these religions. The important thing is that the beliefs and rituals promote tradition, a shared culture, and a sense of community. \
