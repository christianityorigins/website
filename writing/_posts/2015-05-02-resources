With a smaller minority of Semites and Natufians.</p><p>Neolithic = people who originated in the Caucuses region and then moved into Europe and south into the Middle East and North Africa in successive waves roughly from 12,000 to 6,400 years ago. They became the Early Anatolian Farmers (EAF) who became the Iranian Hunter-Gatherers/Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers (CHG)/West Anatolians who became proto-Sardinian peoples and East Anatolians migrated further east into India and became the Harappan civilization. Every ancient Middle Eastern, North African, Indus Valley, Southern European and ancient Northern European civilization (including the Megalith people who built Stonehenge and other megalith structures) was founded by Neolithic people, specifically of the J2 haplogroup [<a href="https://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?224225-Haplogroup-J2-In-The-Indian-Subcontinent-Associated-With-Upper-Castes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>].&nbsp;</p><p>Indo-Aryans = depigmented (albino) Neolithic people.

Around 2,000 BCE, after the domestication of the horse and the invention of the chariot these Indo-Aryans poured down from the Pontic-Caspian steppes.&nbsp;</p><p>Semites = Neanderthal relics who mixed with whatever dominated their ancestors the most: Scythian-Turkic (Cimmerian) mixes from the Pontic-Caspian steppes, Hapiru in Egypt, Neanderthal hybrid mixes in Canaan, the Hittites (2) and Natufians who were 1/4 Sub-Saharan African.</p><p>Europeans = a mixture of three races to varying degrees: Neolithic, Indo-Aryans, and Alpine. Alpine are Western Hunter Gatherer's (WHG), ie. 'Cheddar Man' who are Indigenous Europeans that were heavily domesticated (brachycephalic skull, short mesomorphic body type, round and juvenile facial features/neoteny, bright pink skin/piebaldism, ie. the 'pig' phenotype [<a href="http://humanphenotypes.net/Borreby.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>]).</p>1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3585000/<br />--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6102297/<br />--https://eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1a_Y-DNA.shtml<br />--https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nabataean+busts+jordan+melpomeme&amp;t=ofa&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images<br />--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltmen<br /><br />2. Eezekiel 16:1-316: "The word of the Lord came to me: 2 “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices 3 and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites [Canaan = Modern day Israel]; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite".
