Did Christianity Cause Domestication Syndrome \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_syndrome)\] \[[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/#!po=8.25243)\] and Human Self-Domestication \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-domestication)\] in the West?

Traits of domestication syndrome:

Behavioral:

*   Low in-group preference or sense of tribalism ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635723000888))
*   As part of the system of self-domestication animals begin self-policing group members to enforce the norms of the group and deter other members from behaving in ways that could disrupt the social order. Ex. dogs are often seen growling at or barking at other dogs who they see as behaving inappropriately.
*   No sense of self-agency, independence, and follows orders (once domesticated, being part of the herd becomes more important than being right) ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40656-020-00315-0))
*   Homosexuality (1)
*   Less threat reactivity
*   Poor maternal instincts ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5857534/))

Phenotype:

*   Neoteny ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096361/)) ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/)) ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Neoteny)) and feminization ([ref](https://incels.wiki/w/Feminization)) in males (neotony and feminization comes from hormonal adaptation to domestication. I.e. no pressure for epigenetic expression of high testosterone)
*   Brachycephaly. Short and round skulls that lack an occipital bun (occipital bun = larger craniovolume and a higher IQ). Brachycephaly leads to a reduction of the back of the brain and a smaller amygdala (2). This expresses in political affiliation: people who identify as conservative have a larger amygdala ([ref](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-political-ideology-differences-brain-previously.html)) 
*   Smaller skull in volume ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646786/#!po=8.25243/))
*   Androgyny and emasculation in males ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-019-00126-z))
*   Weak jaws
*   Lower muscle mass in males
*   Lower testosterone in males ([ref](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/08/01/143875.full.pdf))
*   Smaller penis sizes in males
*   Poor eyesight ([ref](https://books.google.ca/books?id=hEy4AAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y))
*   Incompletely developed neural crest which leads to craniofacial abnormalities, neurological problems, lower intelligence, and vision problems ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8633094/)) ([ref](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140714100122.htm/))
*   Notice how the majority of European (especially northern) people now have the domesticated phenotype \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/basic/Alpinid.html)\] or else the pig phenotype? \[[link](http://humanphenotypes.net/Borreby.html)\] (including pink skin tone \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebald)\]). This is the same species-specific domestication process that turned a wolf into a dog \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeSGC_O5_OZYOjFaf9X2b3IGFI2pMPPPILGE2rzzUWfYxgxFatcP81ZTa6BPMn4xLUPjASDJX41whJGBZgGuMefddh-OXbKLzeChjUF2K4uQaVMMEI1A__HSnsL1LfRbxFQm2RdSt-4RLcGAXqokw5E54pW4i8OXTsScuMdgeSLkDAVtuiwpOxXMyWl9E/s1500/wolfvsdog.jpg)\] and a wild boar into a domesticated pig \[[link](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT_wCGxsxJY-7-NPKEliqxVFLud2sWiXE_wFQr7tS1G3-hqk2kmZzoy1UaKbN8kq8RCrFb6SygHVRWNGMjCC93zNc7w1nYX0oQypFf-sEenu_XjIE-GVHUU7uLXydpcjQKdilC2zmowNn4yGvsO8MqAwYyjdQgUpem4CjnFFaF7D_47oI42wyzaagTRnI/s1536/wild-boar-vs-pig-collage.jpg)\]

This is why phenotype is such a good indicator of class and intelligence amongst the European population because over the past two thousand years the aristocracy, elites, and catholic church domesticated the masses of Europeans in the same way that they domesticated livestock (3). 

1\. Homosexuality is another expression of domestication syndrome [[link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02955/full)]. Homosexual preference is more likely in males who received low prenatal testosterone exposure. A standard method for assaying prenatal testosterone exposure is to measure the length of the ring finger (the fourth finger) compared to the length of the second finger: increased prenatal exposure to testosterone tends to be associated with relatively long ring fingers. The largest surveys of homosexual men in the United States, China, and Japan have found a tendency for homosexual men have relatively short ring fingers [[link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12872893/)]. See also: exposure to a high concentration of testosterone during a critical phase of development leads to a male-typical orientation [[link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739566/)]. \
2\. There's a theory that supports the "autistic brain" (as of the extreme male brain theory) is a brain with a tendency to be undomesticated or "failed domestication" [[link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201608/autism-and-domestication-syndrome-in-humans)\]. Undomesticated people are socialized to a lesser degree therefore fall less for propaganda. Schizophrenia is the opposite of this and is a form of hyper-domestication syndrome [[link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201609/schizophrenics-hyper-domesticated-humans)] (see also: testosterone supplementation reverses symptoms of schizophrenia [[link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18626263/)\]), so is Down's Syndrome (see: Down's Syndrome is treated with testosterone supplementation [[link](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/01/hormone-therapy-may-boost-brain-function-for-people-with-downs-syndrome-study-finds)]).  \
--People who identify as conservative have a larger amygdala ([ref](https://phys.org/news/2024-09-political-ideology-differences-brain-previously.html)). Height: Conservative men are taller than liberal men (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200619081004/https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article96150152.html" target="_blank">ref</a>).

Conservative men earn more (<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/609065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>). Intelligence: Conservative men have much higher IQ's than liberal men (<a href="https://reason.com/2014/06/13/are-conservatives-dumber-than-liberals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (a few IQ studies include "Classical Liberals" aka Libertarians in the "Liberal" category to inflate the numbers (<a href="https://reason.com/2014/06/13/are-conservatives-dumber-than-liberals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>). Ignore them). Attraction: Men who are rated physically attractive are more likely to be right-wing (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/10/conservatives-really-are-better-looking-research-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/abs/effects-of-physical-attractiveness-on-political-beliefs/D5214D0CAE37EE5947B7BF29762547EE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/04/14/party_with_most_attractive_followers_conservative.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272716302201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/caveman-politics/201803/science-weighs-in-conservatives-look-better" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/about.illinoisstate.edu/dist/2/123/files/2019/10/Peterson-Palmer-The-Effects-of-Physical-Attractiveness-on-Political-Attitudes.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>). Left-wing men are more likely to report being involuntarily celibate (by measures of magnitude) (<a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2022/12/01/new-ut-study-reveals-the-mental-health-realities-of-incels/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/10/conservatives-really-are-better-looking-research-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>)&nbsp;(<a href="https://incels.is/threads/liberal-men-are-more-likely-to-be-incels-than-conservative-men.490486/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>)&nbsp;(<a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/news/incels-are-not-particularly-right-wing-or-white-but-they-are-extremely-depressed-anxious-and-lonely-according-to-new-research" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>)&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taller-people-politically-conservative_n_57b4ba18e4b0fd5a2f40e5ce" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>). Women who identify as far-left liberal are repulsed by liberal men (<a href="https://archive.vn/o/cZNWf/https://www.bizpacreview.com/2018/03/31/gamma-male-syndrome-why-even-liberal-women-arent-attracted-to-liberal-men-619081" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/10/why-progressive-women-want-to-date-men-who-act-conservative/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://time.com/7197/why-i-cant-date-a-liberal/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) and are greatly attracted to men who identify as being far-right (<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/10/why-progressive-women-want-to-date-men-who-act-conservative/#:~:text=A%202018%20study%20from%20Iowa%20State%20University%20backs,by%20being%20protective%2C%20committed%2C%20and%20by%20providing%20resources.%E2%80%9D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>). Rich liberal women prefer to date conservative men (<a href="https://dailycaller.com/2014/02/14/rich-liberal-women-prefer-conservative-men/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (less than 10% preferred liberal men). Also, despite the propaganda of women being inherently leftist, the studies do not show this to be true. In fact, leftist women are simply adopting the the politics of ressentment. See: Study confirms that ugly women become feminists because they can't attract a man (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2129456/Do-girls-want-career-attract-man-Provocative-study-casts-high-fliers-new-light.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>), and Conservative women are more attractive than liberal women (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12211523/Conservative-women-attractive-liberals-study-says.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-predict-political-views-liberal-conservative-based-on-looks-study-2023-6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/tories-attractive-socialists-conservatives-labour-study-wealthy-good-looking-a8186836.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ref</a>) \
3\. Feudalism was invented simultaneously as institutional Christianity. Both by Constantine, one to enforce the other and vice versa.\
