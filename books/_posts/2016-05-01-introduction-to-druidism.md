1 Druidism

Christianity is a subversion of Celtic Druidism (1) that was filtered through an imperial cult where Asander of Bosphorus aka Julius Caesar (2) took on the Esus/Esos/Hesus/Aisus/Iesus \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esus)\] (3) role. The Galatians of Anatolia were Celtics who followed Druidism and this religion was subverted by a group of rabbi's headed by rabbi Akiva around the time of the Bar Kohiba revolt (132–136 CE). See: On the Origins of Christianity \[[link](https://christcuck.org/on-the-origins-of-christianity)\]. Converting christians to Druidism should be easy as it is the foundation for their religion with the same deity (Esus/Esos/Hesus/Aisus/Iesus), traditions, and rituals (4), but without the old testament and proto-bolshevism slave-morality.

There are only two things that you need to know to understand Druidry:

1.1 Cosmology

The founder of Druidry was Pythagoras (5) who learned from a philosopher named Abaris the Hyperborean \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaris_the_Hyperborean)\] (possibly the same person) who was a Scythian who hailed from Hyperborea (6): _"And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this philosophy"_ -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus. 

So, the Druid cosmology was Pythagorian monism \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)\]. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality. As for the polytheistic deities, some polytheistic monists see the polytheistic deities as sentient personal gods who eminate from the divine, others see them as symbolic representations of natural forces (numen/animism), others are atheists (7) who are attracted to tradition, ancestor veneration, and ancestry. Some atheistic Pagans are inspired by Carl Jung who combined psychoanalysis with Heathenry; the polytheistic deities = 'archetypes (8) of the collective unconscious (9)' to these Pagans.

1.2 Beleifs

Monist cosmology posits that the universe is composed of a single, fundamental substance or reality, meaning that the divine is not a separate, transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it.Therefore, in monist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This self-realization can be understood as a form of self-deification, where the individual recognizes their inherent divinity.

The Druids were the western Brahman caste so philosophical inquiry and intellectual exploration was also at the core of their beliefs.

1.3 Rituals

So, in monist relgions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization or self-deification.

Examples: In some Tantric traditions, rituals and practices like yoga, meditation, and mantra recitation are designed to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and experience union with the ultimate reality. Advaita Vedanta: In this non-dualistic Hindu tradition, rituals and practices like meditation, self-inquiry, and devotion are aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality (Brahman). The goal is to transcend the ego and realize one's inherent divinity.

In the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries (10), it served to allow initiates to see themselves as part of the divine, connected to the natural world and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. To secular Druids who are inspired by Carl Jung, rituals could be ways of manifesting the Jungian archetypes into your life, inducing 'active imagination' (11), or a part of the process of 'individuation' (12)

1\. The etymology of "Druid" stems from the Celtic root Dru-Uides (pl. of Dru-Uis) for "firm knowers".
Same as Celtic Uidta||Uidtu = Science, Knowledge, a cognate of the Sanskrit Veda. Druid = Drvo (Slavic) = Dhruva (Sanskrit).The Druids were the Brahmans of the West, and the Vedas are Druidism that was probably brought to India by the Ram the Druid [[link](https://www.angelfire.com/folk/boutios/Dhruveda.html)\]\
2\. Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to the Indo-Aryan word for 'king' and Julius (Iulius) is similar to both Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for 'sun'). "As-" in Celtic means "God" and "Ander" could be a derivative or variant of the Proto-Indo-European root dyeu-.\
3\. Ancient European deities are all similar, they just have different regional names. For example, Dyaus Pita (Vedic), Zeus (Greek), Jupiter (Roman), Odin (Nordic), Wotan (German), Esus (Celtic), Wotanaz (Slavic), Ukko and Väinämöinen (Finnish), and so on are all derived from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of Dyeus, and Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter'. The Gaulish and Old Irish forms "Esus" or "Esos" derive from the Proto-Celtic "Deiwos" or "Deuos", with the "De" sound shifting to "Es" or "Esos" over time. Wotan is derived from Proto-Germanic Wodanaz, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European root Dyeus. Odin comes from Old Norse and is related to the earlier Proto-Germanic Wodanaz.\
4\. Christmas, celebrated on December 25, coincides with the ancient pagan festival of Yule, which marked the winter solstice. Druids would light fires and decorate trees to symbolize the return of the sun. Easter falls around the spring equinox. Druids celebrated the festival of Ostara, which honored the goddess Eostre, often depicted with eggs and rabbits. These symbols have been co-opted by Christianity, with eggs representing new life and rabbits symbolizing fertility. Druids would celebrate the summer solstice with bonfires and rituals to honor the sun. Christianity's celebration of St. John's Day (June 24) coincides with the summer solstice, and some traditions involve lighting bonfires. Druids would celebrate the autumn equinox with rituals to honor the harvest. Christianity's celebration of the Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6) coincides with the autumn equinox.\
5\. The Irish annals talk about a Druid named Abhras visiting Greece. The Druids were a Pythagorian cult: _"And the Celtic Druids investigated to the very highest point the Pythagorean philosophy, after Zamolxis, by birth a Thracian, a servant of Pythagoras, became to them the originator of this philosophy"_ -- 'The Refutation of All Heresies', Chapter XXII.--The Druids; Progenitors of their System by St. Hippolytus. In the same book St. Hippolytus says: _"Pyrrho was an Academic; this (speculator) taught the in-comprehensibility of everything. The Brahmins among the Indians, and the Druids among the Celts, and Hesiod (devoted themselves to philosophic pursuits)"_. In my book, 'On the Origins of Christianity', I identify Pyrrho of Elis as the creator of Buddism. Zalmoxis was another name of Sabazius, the Thracian version of Zeus. Also, Zalmoxis, or Zalmox or Zalmos, can also be pronounced Salmos which is very close to the Aramaic and Hebrew pronunciation of Solomon. Abraham = 'Ram the Druid', a seer who cured his tribe with mistletoe. He was exiled and took an army with him. He created the caste system in India, created the Magi in Persia. 'A Brahman', a Vedic spiritual leader/teacher, comes from him (*This 'Ram' character shows up many times in history under different aliases in different locations: Ra in Egyptian mythology. Abrahamn (Abraham = Ab Ram, or 'Born of Ram') in the bible. Ram the Aries. Ram/Ramos the Druid. Rama in the Vedas who is a major deity and worshipped as the seventh avatar of Vishnu. In Tibet he is Lama. Speculation: In the Vedas 'Laxman' is the younger brother of 'Rama'. A'lex'ander -> 'Lax'man. So, Ram was Alexander the Great's older brother? Alexander was depicted in coins as a ram god \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_of_Alexander)\]).\
--The name "Abaris" and the Greek word "αβαρίς" (abarís), which is a variant of the word "απαρίς" (aparís), meaning "from the far north" or "Hyperborean". This word is also related to the Greek word "απαρτίζω" (apartizō), which means "to purify" or "to cleanse", similar to the first part of Pythagoras' name. So, was Pythagoras also Abaris the Hyperborean? Very likely.\
--See: The Platonic Lambda Is the Key to Stonehenge. \[[link](https://antiquitasviva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1.23.-kurent-t.-the-platonic-lambda-is-the-key-to-the-stonehenge-composition.pdf)\] (The Platonic Lambda is a mathematical concept that appears in Plato's dialogue Timaeus. It is a geometric representation of the harmony of the universe, and it is based on the idea that the universe is composed of a series of geometric shapes, including triangles, squares, and cubes.The Platonic Lambda is thought to have been influenced by the Pythagorean concept of the "tetractys," which is a geometric diagram that consists of a series of dots or points arranged in a triangular pattern. The tetractys was seen as a representation of the fundamental harmony of the universe, and it was used by the Pythagoreans to illustrate the relationships between different numbers and shapes). Also: 
Stonehenge builders used Pythagoras’ theorem 2,000 years before he was born \[[link](https://www.sciencealert.com/pythagoras-triangle-used-construction-stonehenge)\]\
6\. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for Ireland. The word Atlantis means ‘The Island of Atlas’. The titan Atlas was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the  bearer of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived  on the sacred island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia, the Roman name for Ireland.\

--These Pagans don't worship a particular thing, they just appreciate the unity of existence, or seek to understand the ultimate nature of reality. Ancestor veneration is the only worship they do.\
