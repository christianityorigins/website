On the Origins of Christianity

By Hugo Pepe

_The Jews, that priestly people of ressentiment who knew how to get final satisfaction from their enemies and conquerors through a radical transformation of their values, that is, through an act of the most spiritual revenge. This was appropriate only to a priestly people with the most deeply rooted priestly desire for revenge._ - Friedrich Nietzsche

Imperial Cult

Alexander the Great created the Ptolemaic Cult of Alexander to deify himself and justify his rule over his subjects. The practice of deifying leaders to maintain social order amongst a population was advised by Plato in The Republic as the "Noble Lie," and Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. Alexander's 'Diadochi' (successors) and the Roman aristocracy later copied this custom.

Religious syncretism was a social engineering tool designed to turn people into agents or pawns of the ruling class, serving as a soft-power control system for the imperial elite. These elites used religion, as well as an incredible number of aliases, locations, fictional stories, and faked deaths for their family members to control the population. They role-played as deities, religious figures, and different characters, as if they were actors in a play.

The figure of Jesus Christ (of Nazareth) is a literary creation of these elites, incorporating elements of various historical and mythological figures to appeal to a wide audience. This character then became an avatar for several historical figures in an imperial cult.
  

Here are several related people who were avatars for the composite Jesus character:

*   Julius Caesar. He was deified in two religions: during his lifetime in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (Iupiter-Zeus -> I-Zeus -> Iesus. There was no letter J in Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus', and (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter'), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented, Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high priest) in his religion. Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to the Indo-Aryan word for 'king' and Julius (Iulius) is similar to both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for 'sun'). He was also Asander (a derivative of Alexander), Philocaesar Philoromaios, King of Bosphorus \[[link](https://www.thenazareneway.com/Gospel%20of%20Jesus%20Wife%20Papyrus.htm)\] (the city of Byzantine, later called Constantinople, and now Istanbul was/is located in the area called Bosphorus), and his wife Dynamis Ourania (translates to 'heavenly power'), queen of Bosporus, was Cleopatra's regional alias \[[link](http://thenazareneway.com/Gospel%20of%20Jesus%20Wife%20Papyrus.htm)\]. Dynamis was the granddaughter of Mithridates VI Eupator who carried the title 'king of kings' and she was the niece of Mithridates 'Chrestus', Prince and co-ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus. Asander and Julius Caesar were born in the same year, so was Dynamis and Cleopatra, also, Asander's son, Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios, was born about the same time as Caesarion and Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar. Author Anatoly T. Fomenko in his book 'History: Fiction or Science? Russia. Britain. Byzantium. Rome. New Chronology Vol.IV' (2008) claims that the Roman Empire was simply an outpost for the Byzantine Empire and that the elites were just Ptolemaic Greeks. Author Charles N. Pope in his book called 'Jesus Among the Julio-Claudians' (2017) \[[link](https://books.google.se/books/about/Jesus_Among_the_Julio_Claudians.html?id=c7A3DwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)\] makes this same claim. I subscribe to this theory as well (the Anatolians were Phrygians, Hittites, and Carians. The Carians have a strong connection with the settlement of Rome (Aquilla = Qos = god of Kos of Caria), Sparta, and Canaan). Anatoly T. Fomenko also claims that Jerusalem was located on the Bospherous river.
*   Jesus ben Fabus who was Isa Amen (Jesus Amen) of Rev. iii. 14 who was also Amyntas of Galatia who was also Amyntas Nikator (the name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Persian 'Bagus' means god. ‘Boga’ in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona 'Bog-' means god in Celtic). His palace at Iśauria reveals his name as Iśa. (See: Jesus Christ Was Amyntas of Galatia (2010) by Ranajit Pal \[[link](https://ranajitpal-jesus-from-asia-minor.blogspot.com/2011/06/jesus-christ-was-amyntas-of-galatia_20.html)\]) Amyntas of Galatia was the husband of Stratonice, who was the sister of Asander, the king of the Bosporus.
*   Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias who was also King Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. (See: Jesus, King of Edessa (2012) by Ralph Ellis \[[link](https://x.com/ralfellis/status/1809520320077803525)\]). King Izates of Monobazus was married to the sister of Dynamis's mother.
*   Juba II of Mauritania. Juba II's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is most likely a diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the royal heir of the Massylii tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with Saul's daughter Michal.
*   The son of Antipater III of judea and the grandson of King Herod (See: Herodian Messiah: Case For Jesus As Grandson of Herod (2010) by Joseph Raymond \[[link](https://archive.org/details/joseph-raymond-herodian-messiah-case-for-jesus-as-grandson-of-herod-tower-grove-publishing-2010)\])
*   Apollonius of Tyana.
*   Emperor Vespasian (See: Caesar's Messiah (2005) by Joseph Atwill)

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated etc. and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter, i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius (Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove Sabazios became conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee). Ma'nu is likely a diminutive of Menneus and then Manu-Sabazios becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to 'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes 'bOETHus'. The name Simon probably denoted that he was of the tribe of Simon/Simeon which was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the fifth wife of King Herod and this line produced the Flavian emperors. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus, father-in-law of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus the "Sons of Ptolemy"), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King Herod) below which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the great-grandfather of Antipater III's son. Apollonius of Tyana was likely also Paul the Apostle who was Saulus ben Antipater who was the son of Antipater III making him Simon's great-great-grandson and he was the great-great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

  

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis \[[link](https://www.geni.com/people/Tiridates-II-king-of-Parthia/6000000019000945876)\]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al., were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Marriamme Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases? 

  

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy X Alexander I/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his daughter Cleopatra who Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius Caesars life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward, Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather \[[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)\]), Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book 15, Chapter 2. Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book 17). This is untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death (Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book 12 \[[link](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/complete.ii.xviii.xii.html)\]), so he was 'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania.

Notice the jewish physiognomy and beard shaved in a jewish style? It is possible that this bust is mislabelled and is actually Ptolemy X Alexander I aka Ptolemy Menneus aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus himself.</p>

My theory is that a jewish kohanim family who had tried promoting about a dozen syncretic religions previous to christianity \[[link](https://discoveringancienthistory.wordpress.com/2017/10/24/the-jews-of-sparta-diplomatic-origins-of-religious-synchronization/)\] \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabazios#Jewish_connection)\], and who intermarried with the Egyptian-Byzantine-Greco-Roman elites and were the leaders of the Alexandrian School in Egypt where they were likely the scribes who were in charge of creating Imperial cults for the empire, infused a slave morality into one of these religions around the time that Caligula became emperor, Aulus Avillius Flaccus (the real life Pontius Pilate) became the prefect of Roman Egypt, and the Alexandrian riots of 38 CE to subvert Rome and mentally connect the Romans to jews. 


  

The people I identify specifically as being in involved with creating this imperial cult are Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Ptolemy of Mauretania aka Alexander the Alabarch, his sister-wife Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka 'Philo of Alexandria', and their son Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Emperor Nerva.

  
The Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE) and The Cult of Antinous

During the Bar Kokhba revolt a Rabbi in jerusalem named Akiva ben Joseph (the name Akiva is related to Jacob/James) who lead the Talmudic Pharisees and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer Yetzirah (book of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and modern judaism, and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle claimed that he was brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3) and Gamaliel was the father of Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias who was also King Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene), and who was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome was Edom", preached that Simon bar Kokhba ('bar Kozeva' = 'son of the star' in ancient Hebrew) was the 'messiah' during the Bar Kokhba revolt. Simon bar Kozeva's son was named Rufus which was also the name of the son of Simon of Cyrene. The Gospel of Mark is about Simon of Cyrene and Jesus is meant to be seen as an invisible spirit from heaven come down to accompany Simon and his disciples who then returns after Simon is crucified. 

Two years before the the Bar Kokhba revolt emperor Hadrian created a religion to deify his underage gay lover as the son of god (Osiris-Antinous) called 'The Cult of Antinous' \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous)\]. Historian Cassius Dio claims that Antinous was offered as a human sacrifice to Hadrian (Cassius Dio Cocceianus, Historiae Romanae, book 69, chapter 11 \[[link](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/69*.html)\]) and later was 'resurrected'. The Cult of Antinous actually rivaled christianity as the biggest cult in the empire for a couple of centuries. One of the scribes for this cult was Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos who was a kinsman of the Roman emperor Hadrian. The midrash Tanhuma claims that Onkelos was a nephew of Hadrian and other jewish sources list him as a nephew of emperor Titus. Emperor Hadrian also employed Aquilla of Sinope to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina. Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos was a student of none other than rabbi Akiva. 

Rabbi Akiva's other students included Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope and Shimon bar Yochai (Yohai is a nickname for yochai. The name Yochai means 'YHWAH is gracius' from the Hebrew word Yochanan sometimes transcribed as Johanan. Was he also Johanan the Alexandrian?) who made the Zohar for Kabbalah and was the author of 'The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai' which laid the groundwork for Islam (weaponizing Ishmael [Arabs] to fight Edom) \[[link](https://pages.charlotte.edu/john-reeves/research-projects/trajectories-in-near-eastern-apocalyptic/nistarot-secrets-of-r-shimon-b-yohai-2/)\] \[[link](https://www.q-mag.org/arabs-of-the-8th-century-cultural-imitators-or-original-creators.html)\]. Another student of rabbi Akiva was Aristo of Pella, who is a good candidate for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or 'Ariston' is a name that is related to 'Proteus' The former means 'first-rank, noble' the second derives from 'first'. So, was he also Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Marcion is known to have had a disciple named Lucanus, as documented by Tertullian) and he was the secretary of Mark, or Mahalia, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem. So,  Mark, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope? One other student of rabbi Akiva was Rabbi Meir who the Talmud (Gittin 56a) claims was a grandson of emperor Nero, so rabbi Akiva moved in the best society of the Romans.

'The Secret Gospel of Mark' \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Gospel_of_Mark)\] which speaks about Jesus's homosexuality and the Cult of Antinous came out about the same time. It is possible that the Gospel of Mark was written by Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope for the Cult of Antinous and was grafted on to the Roman imperial cult, or Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope and other scribes at the Alexandrian School in Egypt used the imperial cult as the foundation for the Cult of Antinous and this became christianity. It is possible that this group was trying to subvert the imperial cult multiple times before but the Bar Kokhba revolt was the sign that ideological subversion was the only way to overthrow the Roman empire. Getting people to abandon their religons for a new one is hard, so instead, through religious syncrenism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. So, they just took one of the imperial cults of the time and infused a slave morality into it.

Hadrian would have inherited Julius Caesars position and titles in the Flamen Dialis cult. He also attempted to rebuild jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina, a city dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus. He also built a temple of Jupiter after the Bar Kokhba revolt which enraged the jews. He promoted a self-deification cult where he was the son of Jupiter, as well as the Cult of Antinous. It was probably the combination of these two cults that was used as the foundation for rabbi Akiva and his student's slave morality.

This conspiracy was so elaborate that this group even rewrote history to make it fit with their new religion. Josephus was an alias for Hegesippus (the name Hegesippus is a corruption of Josephus in Greek) who was another student of rabbi Akiva and the book 'The Antiquities of the Jews' was backdated to make christianity look legitimate. It was historical fiction. I would even hazard a guess that this group was responsible for burining down the Library of Alexandria which resulted in the loss of all recorded history up until that point so that they could cover-up the tracks of their psyop religion. 

*Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander were personally responsible for the overthrow of Caligula \[link\], Nero, Galba, Otho, and they paved the way for Vespasian’s accession as the founder of the Flavian dynasty \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Alexander#:~:text=While%20Prefect%20of%20Egypt%20(66–69)%2C%20he%20employed%20his%20legions%20against%20the%20Alexandrian%20Jews%20in%20a%20brutal%20response%20to%20ethnic%20violence%2C%20and%20was%20instrumental%20in%20the%20Emperor%20Vespasian%27s%20rise%20to%20power.%20In%2070%2C%20he%20participated%20in%20the%20Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20as%20Titus%27%20second-in-command.)\]. Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's death. Before his death Nero is quoted as saying that followers of Chretus started the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD) (Tacitus, Annals XV. 44). The burning of Rome was part of the coup to install the crypto-jewish Flavian family into power. Vespasian, going by the alias 'Flavius Scaevinus', was directly involved in this conspiracy to overthrow Nero and burn Rome.\
*After Julius Caesar's death he was deified through the Divine Julius cult. His adopted son Caesar Augustus then took on the name 'divi Iuli filius' ('son of the divine Julius') or simply 'divi filius' ('son of god'). It seems likely that Julius Caesar's other adopted sons of King Herod also took on this title. Also, King Herod's sons, especially his heir Alexander, would have carried the title 'king of the jews' or 'king of judea'.\
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter\_to\_Flora (the Letter to Flora and the Tripartite Tractate write about a Gnostic teacher called "Ptolemy" who I identify as Ptolemy Menneus aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus).\
*The first high priest in the Flamen Dialis cult and claimed son of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was Scipio Africanus. At Rome's lowest point against Hannibal and Carthage Scipio appeared and reversed the course of the war, taking the war to Carthage and defeating Hannibal in the field. He then became the messiah of Rome. He was even called the 'second Romuus' (the mythological founder of Rome). His autobiography described how he did all his "miracles". It was literally a how-to guide on how to present yourself as a Messiah. Curiously, this book, which was the most read book in the Roman Republic, entirely disappeared from circulation apart from one letter which was noted down in the work of another historian after christianity appeared. Julius Caesar and all subsequent emperors probably modeled themselves after Scipio. \
*Kabbalists believe that Rabbi Akiba was a gilgul (reincarnation) of Zimri, a prince of the Tribe of Simeon who participated in the Heresy of Peor. \
*The Syllabine Oracles served as a Prisca Theologia, or styleguide, for the Alexandrian School scribes when they created new religions; Orphism, Neoplatonism, Neopythagoreanism, Valentinianism, Mandaeism, Buddhism, Hermeticism, Gnosticism, Imperial Cults, Christianity, etc., and this is why they all share similar themes.

*   Onias III = Qumran Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls. 'The Anointed One' which in Hebrew is 'moshiach' and often translated as 'messiah'. In Greek, 'The Anointed One' is Chréstos/Christ.
*   Paul the Apostle = three original options:1)Gaius Asinius Pollio (who was the maternal grandfather? of Vespasian \[[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)\]) who raised Caesar Augustus and at least five of King Herod's sons, 2)Saulus ben Antipater who was the son of Antipater/Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, grandson of King Herod (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Chapter 9, section 211), great-grandson of Simon Boethus, brother of Costobarus, and adopted grandson of Gaius Asinius Pollio, or 3)Saulos Thaddeus Alexander Herod, another grandson of King Herod. This character was later taken on by rabbi Akiva. The character Paul/Saul's life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story 'Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor' (also was one of thes epeople Apollonius of Tyana? Apollos -> Pol, or Paul). Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, Book XX (CH 9.4) refers to Paul (Saulus) as related to Herod Agrippa.

The island of Ponza (Pontia) is were where high level political prisoners were kept and he was allegedly sent there after Philo's embassy to Caligula in 38CE). Was he also Polemon II of Pontus? Polemon II became the king of Pontius the same year (38AD) that Aulus Avillius Flaccus was alleged to have been sent to Ponza island to be killed. Polemon II of Pontus was married to King Herod's granddaughter Berenice who eventually married emperor Titus. Berenice was also married to King Herod's grandson/Julius Caesar's adopted grandson and her cousin, Herod, King of Chalcis. \*Edit: Aulus Avillius Flaccus and Polemon II of Pontus were the likely regional aliases of emperor Titus who was Herod, King of Chalcis, the great-great-grandson of King Herod \[[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)\]. He was sent to the Kingdom of Pontus (in modern day Turkey) to become king, not the Ponza (Pontia) islands, and 2)Quintus Tineius Rufus aka Turnus Rufus the Evil [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Tineius_Rufus_(consul_127))\] who was the Roman governor of Judea during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-138 CE), and who was responsible for killing Simon bar Kokhba and rabbi Akiva. Josephus, Wars vii.ii.§ 1 writes that Terentius Rufus is the same Turanus-Rufus as mentioned in the Talmud, Tractate Taanit who is the one who plowed over the Temple. 
*   Simon Boethus (great-great-great? grandson of Onias III and heir of the Zadokite line) = (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. Likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the Latin 'Pater' meaning "father," denoting the Essene High Priest. The Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). After Hellenization many jews adopted Greek names. Matthew became Menelaus in honor of the celebrated husband of Helen, etc., so was he St. Matthew as well?
*   Vespasian = Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Great-grandson of King Herod.
*   Vitellius = Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus. Great-grandson of King Herod.
*   Zoroaster = Baruch ben Neriah. Scribe of Joshua the High Priest (possibly the same person).

Speculative

*   Alexander the Great = Chandragupta (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). \[[link](https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA)\]

BOOK I. THE ORIGINS OF CHRISTIANITY
-----------------------------------

### Chapter 1: The Creation of Slave Morality Religions by Jewish High Priests (Kohanim)

#### 1.1 Introduction to Slave Morality

Every year-zero religion since the Axial Age came from the same priestly family of jews who can be traced back to Babylon, and every one of the religions that they created were slave-morality suicide cults. Under the surface-level narratives of all these slave-morality religions lies the exact same system: they replace ethnic gods and pantheons with monotheism, transvaluate ethnic values (1), and subvert a population by weaponizing the 'ressentiment' of the outcastes (2) so that they attack the warrior and aristocratic castes. Christianity is a slave morality that was created by the same line of Jewish High Priests (kohanim) who created Zoroastrianism and was grafted onto the Old Testament to subconsciously connect the Romans to Jews with Roman trappings added on (myth of Romulus, Divine Julius Cult) to make it more appealing to the Romans.

**1.2 The Role of Jewish High Priests in Creating Slave Morality Religions**

The Jewish high priests, or kohanim, were instrumental in creating religions that promoted a slave morality. From Zoroastrianism to Christianity, these religious frameworks were designed to weaponize the ressentiment of the oppressed classes against the ruling aristocracy.

### Chapter 2: The Origins of Judaism

To understand Christianity it is necessary to explain its precursors and the context in which they were created.

#### 2.1 Ethnogenesis of the Jews

How the jews ended up in Egypt is a matter of contention. One likely hypothesis is that one part of their ancestry that led to their foundation myth originates in Spain, around the Ebro river, and they were brought to Egypt as slaves. Evidence for this theory is that the word 'Hebrew' can derive from the Ebro river in Spain. The name 'Abraham' also derives linguistically from Ebro, i.e., 'Ebroheim', and 'Iber' is also almost identical with the name of Abraham's ancestor Eber or Heber, father of the Hebrews (Genesis 11:15-16). Egyptian sea people/traders sailed along this river in order to bring tin from the British isles and amber from the north and they likely captured slaves from here. The Ebro river was the last remaining natural border keeping Iberia free of Sapiens and thus was mainly inhabited by Neanderthals (see: 'Ebro Frontier' hypothesis (3)).

In Egypt, the jews carried the name 'Habiru' (translates to dust, dirt, outcastes in ancient Egyptian) which was a variant of Ebro, and they were documented to be slaves by the Greek-Egyptian historian Manetho in his book Aegyptica. They were also documented to be mercenaries [\[link\]](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/mercenaries-ancient-medieval-0010745) and at some point they worked for and intermixed with a group called the 'Hyksos' who were described as 'lepers', 'bandits', and 'unpure' by Manetho. The Hyksos were probably mostly the Scythians who were a group of Aryan raiders that hailed from the Pontic-Caspian Steppes (modern day Ukraine). The domestication of the horse and invention of the chariot allowed them to travel great distances. 'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the ancient Akkadians (Josephus. Vol. 5: Antiquities: 8:2:5, pp. 593-595). The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri (known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks). The Cimmerians weren't a race but rather a tribe (Cimmerian likely derives from the Old Iranic Gayamira, meaning "union of clans, or Gāmīra or Gmīra, meaning "mobile unit") (5). This is why the Ashkenazi jews have paternal Steppe haplotypes today (R1a and J1 most commonly) and why they are obsessed with matrilineal descent (Neanderthal males could not create offspring with homo sapien sapiens, but homo sapien sapiens could impregnate Neanderthal females (6)).

These Hyksos managed to become kings of Egypt for a period of time during the 15th Dynasty. The Hyksos pharaoh took the name "Apepi", referring to the Egyptian equivalent of the devil (7), and created a religion based around the worship of Set, the Egyptian god of violence and destruction ("Setianism" is where "Satanism" derives from). "King Apophis, L.P.H., adopted Seth for himself as lord, and he refused to serve any god that was in the entire land except Seth.." -- Papyrus Sallier I, ca. 1274 BCE. The 15th Dynasty also corresponds to the Second Intermediate Period which was when Egypt saw a large influx of foreigners and a demographic transformation (8).

The Hyskos were eventually expelled by the 18th dynasty pharaoh Thutmose III in 1457 BC and they then moved to Canaan (modern day Israel) (Josephus. Contra Apion I.90). Coincidentally, the Ebro river, Crimean peninsula, and Canaan were the last bastions of the Neanderthals and there was lot of human-neanderthal mixing that happened in Cannan (9).

#### 2.2 The Creation of Judaism

It was in Jerusalem (then located in Canaan) where the jews synchronized Canaanite Baal/Baal-zebub (the tetragrammaton YWHA is another word for Baal. See: 'Strong's Concordance reference' #H1180.) into their satan ('setian') worshiping religion. This religion they created was extremely blood thirsty with their tribal war god YWHA demanding the child sacrifice of the first born sons, with them being burned alive (10).

The Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, then conquered Judah in 597 BC which led to the deportation of Jews (586 BC) and many of them moving to Babylon. The Babylonians found human child sacrifice abhorrent and this is what led to the Babylonians destroying Solomon's Temple and the jews rewriting the Old Testament to retcon their entire history with Sumerian and Babylonian creation myths to ingratiate themselves/not arouse anger in the Babylonians (the flood story is stolen from the Epic of Gilgamesh, the creation story is stolen from the Enuma Elish, the Moses story is stolen from the Legend of Sargon, the Adam and Eve story was stolen from Enki and Ninhursag, their code of laws was stolen from King Ur Tablets). They also started offering their savage god just foreskins instead of the full baby as a sacrifice, although they have been continually accused of the ritual murder of gentile babies since then (11).

The authors/compilers of the first version of the old testament were Jeremiah and Baruch, who were probably the same person. They created judaism as one of the earliest psyops ever created and it was used to control the social behavior of other jews and to promote ethnocentrism in the form of a religion. While in Babylon, at the same time they created this tribal group strategy religion for their in-group, they created Zoroastrianism as a slave morality for the out-group (Babylonians and Persians) which was the progenitor of every slave morality that followed.

\*Ptolemy I Soter summoned 72 Babylonian Jewish high priests (kohanim) to Alexandria to translate the Hebrew Bible. It was in Alexandria where they wrote the Pentateuch and Septuagint. See: Chapter 7. The Alexandrian School. These jewish high priests opened up some books at the Library of Alexandria and cut-and-pasted Greek philosophy into their religion. Plato’s hypothetical perfect colony called Magnesia, from his thesis called law. Ancestor received law from a deity, hereditary priesthood rather than king, as well as the division into 12 tribes were all part of the formula. Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) is where the story of Abraham comes from, and Plato's The Laws (347 BC) is where their laws came from.  
\*Eber (Genesis 10:24) comes from a word meaning across or "the opposite side" (Strong's #s 5676 and 5677) and many ancient European names have this root: Iberia (Spain), Ebro River (in Spain), Hibernia (Ireland), Hebrides (islands off the coast of Scotland), Iberian kingdom (modern Georgia \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iberia)\]), Hebrus river in Illyria, so it was probably originally an Aryan word that applied to Aryan tribes, like how Ashkenazi originally referred to the Scythians', that came to be applied to the Jews.

\*John 8:44 in the New Testament, when Jesus speaks to the Pharisees, also refers to YHWH being the devil: _"You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."_
\*The author of the Book of Kings speaks about passing one's son and daughter through fire (II Kings 16:3 \[son\], 17:17, 21:6 \[son\]. II Kings 23:10 speaks about "passing one's son or daughter through fire to Moloch.".
\*There are multiple sections in the Torah, Midrash, and Talmud that condone cannibalism and eating their enemies: Bava Batra, II Samuel 161:8, Isiah 51:4, Midrash Leviticus Rabbi 13:3. _"And Rabba says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will prepare a sukka for the righteous from the skin of the leviathan, as it is stated: “Can you fill his skin with barbed irons \[besukkot\]”"_ (Job 40:31). \[[link](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.75a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)\]
_"Since the second century BC, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had identified the evil god Seth-Typhon (often depicted as a donkey-like creature) with the Jewish god Yahweh"._ 'The Donkey Deity' by M. David Litwa \[[link](https://academic.oup.com/book/39211/chapter-abstract/338714124?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\]. "Set" is the Egyptian god of violence and destruction and "Typhon" was the deadliest creature in Greek mythology.

### Chapter 3: The Origins of Zoroastrianism

Zoroaster was Baruch ben Neriah (12) who was a member of the priestly caste of jews in Babylonia who created Zoroastrianism as a slave morality system in order to subvert the people of the Iranian Plateau. The subversion was done as revenge on the Babylonians for the destruction of Solomon's Temple and the deportation of Jews (586 BC) and despite the last king of Babylon, Nabonidus, treating the jews well (13). Very shortly after its foundation in 550 BC the Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great aka Kurushi Kabir (Kurushi = "lord of the sun", "kabi = great. Cyrus translates to kurosh in ancinet Persian) wiped the Babylonians out, and allowed the Jews to return to Canaan (539 BC). Through the Edict of Cyrus the jews were then allowed to have their own autonomous province called Yehud Medinata and also build their Second Temple (Ezra 6:14), beginning Second Temple Judaism. Obviously, this happened due to the extreme influence of Zoroastrianism, a Jewish creation, which Cyrus promoted.

All the troubling aspects of christianity originate in Zoroastrianism: monotheistic deity that judges you when you die, eternal hell, universalism, sin/salvation, confession of sins, self-deification to weaponize/empower the lowest castes. Zoroastrianism also has a religious commandment called 'Xwedodah' that commands Zoroastrians to marry and procreate with their siblings, with punishment for not doing so!

#### 3.1 Zoroaster and Jewish Influence

Zoroastrianism would go on to influence every slave morality religion that came later, including Buddhism and every one that came from the Alexandrian School in Egypt, which was a Hellenic school to pump out even more slave morality fiction to control the masses.

\*Baruch ben Neriah's grandfather was named 'Ma'aseiah'/Hoshaiah (Jeremiah 32:12-16), the 'king's son' (also the Prophet Isaiah? 'Ma'aseiah'/Hoshaiah could be alternate versions of Isaiah. Also, was Hoshaiah also Jeshua son of Je-Zedek (Zadok III)? Hoshaiah and Jeshua both mean "Yahweh is salvation.") who was probably one of the sons of king Ahaz aka Jehoahaz II (Jehoahaz is close to Jehoshua/Jesus) who was killed by Zichri in the invasion of Judah by Pekah, king of Israel (2 Chr. 28:7). King Ahez is recorded to have burned his children alive at the Valley of Hinnom \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna)\] (The King James Version of the Bible translates Gehinnom with the Anglo-Saxon word hell). Four of Ma'aseiah'/Hoshaiah's sons were: Azariah, Zedekiah, Zephaniah and Neriah. Baruch's grandmother must have been the biblical Jezebel. The Gospel of Matthew lists Ahaz of Judah in the genealogy of Jesus. Baruch's brother, Seraiah ben Neriah, was the chief chamberlain (R.V.) to Zedekiah. According to the Old Latin Version of the Apocryphal Book of Baruch (i. 1) he was of the tribe of Simeon.  
\*In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus "The Anointed One" which in Hebrew is "moshiach", often translated as "messiah". In Greek "The Anointed One" is Chréstos/Christ or Soter. "This prophet, Cyrus, through whom were to be redeemed His chosen people, whom he would glorify before all the world, was the promised Messiah, 'the shepherd of Yhwh' (xliv. 28, xlv. 1)."  
\*Zarathustra likely derives from the Hebrew word "Zerah" which means "rise", or it's related Hebrew word Zara which means "growing seed" (see below for more on this word). Another connection is that "Jeremiah" in Arabic is Armiah which correlates to Zoroaster's supposed native place called Urmiah. The texts the 'Apocalypse of Baruch' \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Baruch)\] and the 'Rest of the Words of Baruch' \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_of_the_Words_of_Baruch)\] hint at Jeremiah and Baruch being the same person (Jeremiah's "visions" are described by Baruch in the first person).  
\*Interestingly, Cyrus the Great's successor Darius the Great's full name was Darayavahu. Yavahu is uncommonly like Yehouah (YHWH). Vahu is the Iranian god of the wind, that became, like the Hebrew, to mean breath and so life, so Yavahu literally means the same as YHWH. Scholars admit the etymology of "DR" ("ZR") is puzzling. \[In Aramaiac and Iranian the d and the z could interchange, e.g. Manda= Manasseh\]. Literally, "zara" refers to the action of sowing seed in the fields (Gen 26:12; Isa 37:30), and seems to be a Semitic root. So, Zara in Hebrew is seed, and Darayavahu can be read in Hebrew meaning "seed (progeny) of Yehouah," "seed of the living god.". In the Book of Daniel and the Book of Esther 2:1-23 it is claimed that Darius's son Xerxes I (Ahasuerus) was the grandson of Ahasuerus and his jewish wife Esther who was a descendant of Israel (Jacob) through Benjamin, Kish and Shimei. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XI, Chapter 6, repeats the same claim. Also, the Sefer HaYashar (Book of the Righteous) claims that Darius the Great was a descendant of King Saul through his daughter Merav. Persia became multicultural after Darius. Darius the Great was also the one who wiped out the Scythians during his Scythian campaigns (14).  
\*Darius the Great's grandson Artaxerxes I had a jewish cup-bearer named Nehemiah (Neh 2:1) who must have come form a royal family and thus was a descendant of Baruch ben Neriah. This shows how close Baruch ben Neriah's family was to the Persian aristocracy.  

### Chapter 4: The Origins of Buddhism

Gautama Buddha was Gaumata Bardya the son of Cyrus the Great who was the one who spread Zoroastrianism. The Persepolis Tablets (PFS 79, PFS 796 and PF 250) which date from the time of Darius the Great are filled with Buddhist iconography and tell a story that Darius the Great came to power by overthrowing the "stargazer-Magus" Gaumata in Babylon. Gaumata Bardya was the satrap (governor) of the Persian province of Bactra (modern day Afghanistan).

Buddhism is a philosophy and religion that is focused on escaping suffering. Central to this belief is the Four Noble Truths, which explain the cause of suffering (desire) and the path to ending it (enlightenment through the Eightfold Path). Buddhism is clearly a slave-morality that is designed to turn its followers into pacifists and submissives and obviously benefited Gaumata Bardya and/or the Greco-Bactrians that ruled Bactria.

#### 4.1 Buddhism’s Roots in Zoroastrianism

Symbolism, beliefs, and themes that originate in Zoroastrianism show up in Buddhism. For example, Ahura Mazda has also been called Buddha Mazda, specifically in Afghanistan where Buddhism was a major religion \[[link](https://www.hindupedia.com/en/Zoroastrianism_and_Hinduism)\]. There are also numerous overlapping customs, such as spiritual initiation, vegetarianism, and the use of fire in worship. Both religions also share similar prayer practices and ceremonies, such as the veneration of ancestors and purification rituals.

**4.2 The Hellenization of Buddhism**

After its inception, Buddhism was further influenced and spread by the Greco-Bactrians. Pyrrho of Elis, who traveled to India with Alexander the Great, created Bactrian Buddhism (15). This form of Buddhism was further developed in Alexandria and later through Ashoka the Great's syncretic efforts in India (16).

### Chapter 5: Alexander the Great

Alexander the Great was an archetype for the Jesus figure. The jews declared him a messiah, or "The Anointed One" (Chréstos/Soter) (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b) because he "liberated" them from the Persians in 330 BC. Paradoxically, the Jews did the same with Cyrus the Great when he in turn "liberated" them from the Babylonians. The Jews also told Alexander the Great that the book of Daniel was a prophecy about him (it wasn't, they wrote it after they met him). The Book of Daniel "prophesied" of Alexander the Great of Greece conquering the whole world even Israel. He was called the Ram of God by Prophet Daniel and in Daniel 8:5-7 a male goat with a large horn between his eyes suddenly arises from the west and smashes both horns of the ram. The angel Gabriel tells Daniel this goat represents the kingdom of Greece and its large horn is its first king,

#### 5.1 Alexander's Influence on Religious Thought

YHWH = Jehova = Jove (Yoweh is similar to Latin Iove) = Jupiter = Ye-Zeus (YHWH + Zeus). Alexander claimed to be the son of Zeus (Zeus-Amun, Zeus-Ahura Mazda, Zeus-Yahweh, etc.).

<p align="center">
Fig. 1.2. Alexander the Great as Zeus Ammon (or Jupiter Ammon), the ram god. The Greeks had identified the Egyptian god Ammon with Zeus, the Romans identified Ammon with Jupiter.</p>

#### 5.2 Alexander as a Prototype for the Jesus Figure

Other similarities: according to the first-century A.D. historian Plutarch, Alexander's mother Olympias told her son that he had been conceived when a thunderbolt -- interpreted as Zeus -- entered her womb, so he was divinely birthed. He died at 33. 'The Son of the Man' is a Koine->Aramaic->Koine mistranslation of Alexander and he was the "King of Kings" \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Kings#Hellenic_usage)\].

  

\*Alexander indirectly became the Jesus prototype. Julius Caesar called himself the Roman Alexander and stole a lot of Alexander's mythology for his religion called the Divine Julius Cult which was plagiarized to make Christianity more appealing to the Romans. See: Chapter 9. The origins of Christianity.
\*A non-mainstream version of history, but one that is recorded in Persian and Islamic sources (17), is that Alexander the Great was a Persian prince (Bupares) who was the son of Kai Bahman (Artaxerxes II Memnon), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon was a province of Persia that his father was governor of. Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon' (18) also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33 (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a posthumous birth/'resurrection'. He resurrected in India with the regional alias of Chandragupta (Alexander is Iksander in Persian and "Alakshandra" in Sanskrit and Gupta means 'guardian' or 'protector' in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). Evidence of this is that the Sanskrit language might be a dialect of Avestan, or a Hellenized variant of Avestan, and the similarities of customs and religions (19). Also, there is strong evidence that Alexander's successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, ruled India with the regional identity of Ashoka the Great (20). See: Alexander Romance (21), The life of Alexander of Macedon (22), and Alexander the Great: Beyond the Divide by Charles N. Pope (23).  
\*Alexander is also identified as the Islamic prophet Dhu al-Qurnayn (He of Two Horns). His name comes from coins depicting him as Zeus Ammon, a two-horned pagan god (see: Fig 1.1.).  

### Chapter 6: Ancient India

#### 6.1 The Asuras and Jewish Influence

The earliest mention of the jews being in India is in the Indian religions. They were the Asuras (24) who were described as power seeking demons (25). They probably moved east after the Assyrian expulsion in 733/2 BCE. Then, several centuries later in the 3rd century BC, Aristotle, quoting his pupil Clearchus who traveled to India, and recorded in Josephus's Contra Apion, wrote that there were jewish "priests" and "philosophers" in India in the 3rd century BC: "Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their name from the country they inhabit, which is called Judea.". Megasthenes (350 BC - 290 BC) recorded the same thing: "the Jews were an Indian tribe or sect called Kalani".  

Brahmin (Brahama) -> Ibrahim -> Abraham. A(Braha)m(in). The Brahmin pray to Shiva and the Jews call their schools Yeshiva, Abraham's wife is Sarah, Bhrahma's wife is Sarasvati, etc. Also, KRISN (Krishna) is close to KRIS-tia-N.The Asuras were often in conflict with the Devas, representing a dualistic struggle akin to the Zoroastrian concepts of good and evil. This dualism mirrored the Jewish narrative of righteous and unrighteous paths, establishing a foundational mythos that would influence later Indian spiritual traditions.

#### 6.2 The Aryan Invasion and the Evolution of Indian Religions

The Indus Valley civilization was founded by Neolithic (Med) people from Iran (Harappan civilization). They mixed with R1a haplotyped Aryan invaders from the Pontic Caspian Steppes (26) who brought the Sanskrit language and the ancient Vedas. Was it through the Scythian connection that the jews moved from the Asura caste to the Bhramin caste? Or Cyrus the Great or his son Gaumata? Or Alexander the Great? After Alexander, the jews had a Judean based Qahal that stretched into Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Did it stretch into India as well?  

The Aryan invasion around 1500 BCE introduced new cultural and religious ideas into the Indian subcontinent, leading to a blending of indigenous beliefs with those of the incoming Aryans. This period saw the foundation of Vedic texts, which were heavily influenced by the existing cultural practices, including those brought by Jewish settlers.

The interactions between these groups led to a rich tapestry of beliefs, with the Vedic tradition incorporating elements of Jewish thought, particularly regarding morality and the nature of the divine. The emergence of Hinduism was influenced by these syncretic processes, which created a complex religious landscape characterized by myriad deities and philosophical schools.

\*A few authors have claimed that the Dravidians were Ethiopians that the jews imported to India via South India and Sri Lanka to work as slaves in the spice trade and in the marble mines (also to create tribal conflict with the Aryans). Importing them in large numbers from the south meant that they went undetected by the Aryans in the north. From Ethiopia it is a straight line route to Sri Lanka via boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These Ethiopian slaves then mixed with indigenous Australoid/Denisovans who were similar to Australian Aborigines. This slave-trade would obviously have made them very rich. Is this how they became the Brahmins? "

An interesting fact is that the Radhanite, who owned the Silk Road trade, were their descendants. These Radhanite/Babylonian jewish slave traders would eventually go on to dominate the white slave trade of Eastern Europe and they were the ones who founded Khazaria in Eastern Europe as their base of operations (see: 'A Theory of Khazars and Ashkenazi Jews' by Pierre Simon. Occidental Observer. February 8, 2024). Their descendants went on to start/control the transatlantic slave trade.

### Chapter 7: The Alexandrian School

#### 7.1 The Role of the Alexandrian School in Religious Syncretism

Alexander the Great's successors ("Diadochi") were Seleucus I Nicator who controlled a large chunk of the eastern territories, including Mesopotamia and Persia, Diodotus I Soter who controlled Bactria (possibly also India under the alias Ashoka the Great), and Ptolemy I Soter who controlled Egypt. Following in the tradition of Alexander the Great (Ptolemaic Cult of Alexander (28)), the Seleucids (Mithraism which was Zoroastrianism + slave morality), and the Bactrians (Buddhism), Ptolemy I Soter created his own slave morality religion called the Serapis Christus cult (29) which was meant to bridge the gap between the Greek and Egyptian cultures and subjugate the foreign Egyptian people to his rule. This new god, Serapis, combined aspects of Egyptian deities like Osiris and Apis  (Serapis = Osiris + Apis = Osir-Apis = Ser-Apis) with Greek gods like Zeus, and had an Egyptian body and Greek head.

#### 7.2 The Creation of the Septuagint and Its Impact

According to the Letter of Aristeas (30) Ptolemy I Soter summoned 72 Babylonian Jewish high priests (kohanim) to Alexandria to translate the Hebrew Bible. It was in Alexandria were these jewish priests wrote the Pentateuch and Septuagint (31). It is possible to identify who some of these jewish high priests were, and they were the descendants of the Zadokite jewish high priests who created Zoroastrianism. Moreover, their descendants were the ones who created Christianity.  
  

In the book The Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus, Book XX, Chapter 10 (32) he writes that Onias I was the leader of the Babylonian jews who went to Egypt. Onias I was the heir of the Zadokite (High Priest) dynasty that traces back to Joshua the High Priest. Baruch ben Neriah was the scribe for Joshua and in the Old Latin Version of the Apocryphal Book of Baruch (i. 1) it says that Baruch was of the tribe of Simeon (same as Onias I). These Babylonian jews settled in an area of Egypt that they called the 'Land of Onias' (33) where they created a sacrifice cult at the 'Temple of Onias' (34). Josephus also writes that Onias I was a friend of Alexander the Great (Antiquities, Book. 8, section 7) and later Ptolemaic kings (Antiquities, Book. 13, section 69) and it was through this connection that this family not only were able to acquire land and protection but eventually became aristocrats who married into the Ptolemaic dynasty (Onias I was also the jewish high priest who tried to convince the Spartan king Areus I that the Spartans were jews and promoted an Abrahamic-Herculean syncretic religion to them (35)).  


The son of Onias I, Simeon the Righteous (aka Simeon the Just aka Shimon HaTzaddik --  HaTzaddik ("the righteous one") obviously comes from Zadok ("righteous")), was the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) of Israel and one of the last remnants of the Men of the Great Assembly (36). The Talmud (Yoma 69a) claims that Alexander the Great "prostrated himself at the feet of Simeon the Righteous". Then, to flatter Alexander, Simon the Righteous named every son of jewish priests (kohanim) born that year Alexander (37). Also, like Cyrus the Great, Alexander the Great was declared a messiah, or "The Anointed One" (Chréstos/Soter) (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b) because he "liberated" the jews from the Persians.  


The son of Simeon the Righteous was Onias III, who was also an "Anointed One" as prince according to Daniel Ch 9:25. Onias III was probably also the Qumran Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.  
  

The descendant and heir of Onias III, and the heir to the Zadok high priest line, was Simon Boethus (great-great-great grandson of Onias III? (38)) aka Simon Magus (39) aka Ptolemy Bar Mennius (Menelaus was the name of the mythical founder of Sparta and this family adopted his name (40), and "Ptolemy" signifies that this family had intermarried with the Ptolemaic royal family by this point) who was the creator of Gnosticism.  
  

After the creation of the Serapis cult, the Alexandrian School then made an industry out of taking existing religions and then adding to them a psy-op slave-morality foundation. Manichaeanism, Valentinianism, Buddhism (41) Hermeticism (Philo of Alexandria’s syncretic philosophy to Hellenize the Canaanite religion of the Levant), and christianity (slave morality targeted to Rome) all came from this school. The Sibylline Oracles were a style guide for their students (42).  
  

Alexander the Great's Egyptian heir Ptolemy I Soter apparently shared Alexander's esteem for the jews. According to Josephus (Antiquities, Book. 12, chapters. 1, 2, pp. 308-309), and The Letter of Aristeas, 12,19, it is recorded that after Ptolemy I Soter took Judea he brought 120,000 Jewish captives to Egypt from the areas of Judea, Jerusalem, Samaria, and Mount Gerizim. "Soter" in ancient Greek is similar to Christios, i.e. "anointed one". Was he proclaimed a Christ and Messiah by the jews like Cyrus and Alexander? Ptolemy I Soter's descendants also obviously had a positive view of the jews because by Roman times the Jews constituted 40% of the population of Alexandria (43), and members of this priestly jewish family carried Ptolemaic royal names.  

\*Manetho in his book 'Aegyptiaca' wrote that the Hyksos or Habiru were lead by a priest named Osarseph and that Osarseph = Moses. Interestingly, Osarseph also = Ahmose Sipair or Serapis. The "Si" symbol in Si-pair, ie. "son of", is really "Ser". Also, pharaoh Thutmose who expelled jews to Jerusalem has been proposed as "Moses". Was the Serapis Cult invented by the same family of jewish high priests who invented Zoroastrianism as a way of connecting the Egyptian people to them and flattering Thutmose III and then was later retconned for Ptolemy Soter?

### Chapter 8: The Origins of Gnosticism

Platonism was the school of thought that started with Plato's teachings and mixed Aristotle, Socrates, and Pythagoras into it. Neo-Platonism was popular with the Roman elite. This is why Jews (especially in Alexandria Egypt) wanted to infiltrate and subvert it with Gnosticism. 

#### 8.1 Simon Magus and the Creation of Gnosticism

Simon Boethius, a Jewish high priest and heir of the Zadokite dynasty and a descendant of Joshua the High Priest, Baruch ben Neriah, and Onais I, was Simon Magus who was the creator of Gnosticism ("gnosis", or hidden knowledge) (44). The name Magus comes from Magi ("Simon the Magi"), which was the name of the proto-Zoroastrian priests who worshiped the evil brother Angra Mainyu more than the good brother Ahura-Mazda, which comes from the twin-brothers Vedic gods Varuna-Mitra. The theological bridge between Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism was likely Manichaeanism or Mandaeism in which Simon was the prophet Mani in both religions. Like Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism, Manichaeanism and Mandaeism feature a dualistic worldview, but Manichaeism emphasizes escaping the material world through knowledge ("gnosis") and good works, and Mandaeans believe in one God of Light and revere John the Baptist. Zurvanism, which was a determinist sect of Zoroastrianism, could be another link between Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism. Unlike Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism sees Zurvan, the god of infinite time, as the ultimate source giving birth to twins Ahura-Mazda (good) and Angra Mainyu (evil), just like the Demiurge in Gnosticism. This challenged Zoroastrianism's free will concept, suggesting fate was predetermined. Fundamental to both Zurvanism and Gnosticism is a dualistic view of the world, with a good and evil force in constant conflict.

The central belief in Gnosticism is that life is evil and that gnostic followers should not reproduce. It is an antinatalist cult to get the Greeks and Romans to reduce their populations while raising them in a slave morality at the same time.

Simon was also Ptolemy Menneus (45) and he was married to the Hasmonean Princess Elizabeth of Jerusalem, Queen Alexandra II (46) and his daughter was Mariamne Boethus aka Alexandra Salome aka Mary Salome aka Helena Of Adiabene [\[](#ftnt47)(47) (Helene was philologically interchangeable with Selene and from there Salome) who was the fifth wife of King Herod. Ptolemy Menneus was also Ma'nu II of Oshroene/Adiabene (48).  

Simon had a couple Gnostic sects that worshiped him: the Simonians (49), and a religion called Sophia (50). He was also likely the prophet Mani in Manichaeanism and Mandaeism. The Nassenes (51), who were one of the earliest Gnostic sects, attributed divinity to Simon's daughter Mariamne Boethus aka Mary Magdalene in xtianity (52). Simon's other daughter Martha = St. Martha of Bethany who was married to Judean high priest Joshua 'Jesus' ben Gamla/Gamaliel who was the son of Gamaliel (53) ("Paul the Apostle" claimed that he was brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)) who was a grandson of Hillel the Elder (54) which would also connect Simon to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Lazarus of Bethany = Eleazar ben Boethus, Simon's son, another son was Bartholemew ("Bar Ptolemy"), and Matthias the Apostle = Matthias Boethus, his brother. His great-grandson Saulos Thaddeus Alexander Herod (55) = Paul the Apostle? and his great-great grandchildren Berenice = Saint Veronica (Veronica is the Latin alteration of the Greek name Berenice) and Marcus Julius Agrippa II = Marcus/Mark.

#### 8.2 Gnosticism's Influence on Early Christianity

Simon's line of descent to focus on is through his grandson Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II ("Iuba" is most likely a diminutive of Iehuva, but "Iuba" also translates to "love" in the Berber languages of Mauretania that he was king of exactly like "Philo" translates to "love" in ancient Greek) who was Simon's grandson through his daughter Mariamne Boethus (56). Alexander (son of King Herod) was married to Cleopatra Selene II (daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII) aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Alexander (son of King Herod) and Cleopatra Selene II were both adopted by Julius Caesar and were raised in Rome (Julius Caesar and Augustus adopted heirs of many royal families and got them to intermarry because then every Roman client state would be ruled by a single family and they would then be easier to control through proxy)).

 <p align="center">Fig 1.3. (L) Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II. (R) Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania</p>

        

Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II had two prominent children who were married to each other:

  

*   Alexander (grandson of King Herod) (57) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or Cleopatros) aka Phraates IV (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of Adiabene. Alexander (grandson of King Herod) had over a dozen aliases (58) and he was the richest man in the world at the time. Note how 'The Son of the Man' is a Koine->Aramaic->Koine mistranslation of Alexander and that as the grandson and heir of King Herod he was the 'King of Judea', 'King of the Jews'. Also, through his mother he was a descendant of the Egyptian Pharaohs, hence 'Son of God' (59) as all Egyptian Pharaohs were called that. Like his ancestor Onias III and his adopted grandfather Julius Caesar Alexander (grandson of King Herod) used the title "Chrestus" ("anointed one") (60). He is also Jesus in the bible. He was married to his sister (see below).
*   Philo Judaeus of Alexandria ("Julius Philo", of the Julia gens (61), because she was the adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar), which was an alias for King Herod's granddaughter (Salome III?) aka Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Theophilus in the bible. She was also 'Pallas' (as in the ancient Greek goddess 'Pallas-Athena' who in mythology frequently disguised herself as a man) (62) who was Claudius and Nero's secretary, and 'Antonia Caenis' ('Caenis' was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man), who was Vespasian's mistress (63)

\*Professor Revilo P. Oliver believed that after the First Jewish–Roman War (66–74 CE) which saw the death of the jewish "messiah" Simon bar Kokhba ('bar Kozeva' = "son of the star" in ancient Hebrew), a confederation of rabbis then assembled who were led by Rabbi Akiva (who was a student of Gamaliel) and who included his students Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope, Simon ben Yohai (obviously of the Simeon line and a descendant of Simon Boethius), and Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, and they were the ones who invented Christianity \[[link](http://www.revilo-oliver.com/rpo/Forgery_of_Our_Own.html)\] as a psyop the subvert the Romans. Rabbi Akiva was the one that came up with the idea that Rome was Edom. 
\*Simon ben Yohai was the author of _The Secrets of Simon ben Yohai_ \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secrets_of_Rabbi_Simon_ben_Yohai)\] which were the secrets that were revealed to him when he was hiding in a cave on account of (the persecutions of) Caesar king of Edom (i.e., Rome). His secrets were his blueprint for the destruction of Rome (Esau) and all western "gyrwn" (Aramic form of goyim) through using Ishmael (Arabs) and is the manuscript for Islam. He parodied Attila the Hun ("Allah") and his uncle Ruglia waging war against Rome because he wanted the Arabs to wage war against Eastern Rome (Byzantine). "The second king who will arise from Ishmael will be a friend of Israel. He will repair their breaches and (fix) the breaches of the Temple and shape Mt. Moriah and make the whole of it a level plain. He will build for himself there a place for prayer upon the site of the ‘foundation stone,’ as Scripture says: ‘and set your nest on the rock’ (Num 24:21). He will wage war with the children of Esau and slaughter their troops and capture a large number of them, and (eventually) he will die in peace and with great honor.".
\*Matrilineally, Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister wife "Philo" descend from Mark Antony and Cleopatra. The Talmud says that Mark Antony was born to a jewish mother. His first wife Fulva was jewish, and Cleopatra was a Ptolemaic ruler and her family had a long history of intermarriage with Jews, so this family was almost fully jewish. The bust attributed to Mark Antony that is housed in the Vatican Museum was made over a century after he died during the Flavian dynasty. This: https://imgur.com/7RnVvRv is the only bust of him that is believed to have been made during his lifetime.

### Chapter 9: The Origins of Christianity

Christianity is a Gnostic sect that was retconned with the Roman myth of Quirinus aka Romulus (64) and the Divine Julius cult (65) and then targeted at Rome with Alexander (grandson of King Herod) elevated to the Romulus/Iulius figure (66).

Christianity was one branch of the slave morality that originates with the Zoroastrian conspiracy in Babylon and was spread in Rome because members of this priestly Zadokite jewish family were able to amass power within Rome.

  

\*Scipio Africanus and Julius Caesar were both claimed to be the 'new Romulus'.

  

#### 9.1 The Role of the Boethians and Herodians in Rome ####

Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus adopted members of many royal families and got them to intermarry so that their countries would be easier to control through proxy, but King Herod's father Antipater the Idumaean apparently provided troops for Julius Caesar and helped him during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC) (68) and because of this Antipater the Idumean's descendants were given an elevated position even within Rome. They were raised in the same household as Caesar Augustus (69) and even became emperors.  
  
Herodians in Rome to take note of:  
  
Alexander (grandson of King Herod), who was the richest man in the world at the time, and his sister wife Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka "Philo of Alexandria" had two prominent sons:

  

*   Marcus Julius Alexander aka Gaius Calpernius Piso aka Izates bar Monobazus (aka Pliny the Elder?).
*   Tiberius Julius Alexander (Tiberius Julius Alexander's son was named 'Philopappos' and one of his mothers recorded maiden aliases was 'Alexandria bat Matthias' (70) which is where the pseudonym 'Joseph bar Matthias' comes from. Also, drop the initial b and final s in the name "Bar Mathias" and you get (Joseph of) Arimathea) aka Arrius Calpernius Piso (71) and Arrius comes from "Arrius Varus" (72), one of his many alias, which in turn is probably a diminutive of his uncle's name Aristobulus) aka Emperor Nerva (73).

<p align="center">
Fig. 1.6. Erroneously identified 'Josephus' bust which I idntify as Tiberius Julius Alexander. Compare it to Nerva's depictions</p>

  

Emperor Vespasian was another likely grandson of King Herod. He was Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, son of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV who was Julius Caesar's adopted son (74) (ignore the elder busts of him which have idealized Julio-Claudian features and look at his youngest depictions (75)). Vespasian was his title, not his name (Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pasius = Peace. 'Vespasian' = 'King Peace'). He was also 'Flavius Scaevinus' the conspirator who was involved in Nero's assassination. 'Philo of Alexandria' aka Salome III was also 'Antonia Caenis' who was Vespasian's first cousin and mistress and her son Tiberius Julius Alexander was Vespasian's son-in-law/adopted son and the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard which made him arguably the most powerful man in the empire during Vespasian's reign. Philo of Alexandria aka Salome III was also the first cousin and ex-mother-in-law to King Herod's granddaughter Berenice aka St. Veronica (Veronica is a transliteration of the Greek name Berenike meaning 'victory') who was empress of Rome through her relationship with Vespasian's son Titus. Berenice's brother, Marcus Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an incestuous relationship with (76) before moving on to her cousin, was the governor of all foreign Roman territories except Egypt (which was governed by Tiberius Julius Alexander) during the Flavian period..

<p align="center">
Fig. 1.7. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I</p>

  

  

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesars adopted son. Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his sister). He abdicated his position in favor of his younger brother.  
  
So, five emperors in a row were King Herod's grandsons or great-grandsons: Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva.

Every Roman Emperor from Hadrian (likely an acronym for Herodian (77)) onward descends from King Herod mainly through two jewish women: Arria the Younger and Cleopatra of Mauretania or Cleopatra IX ("Philo"), and by my count 37 Roman and Byzantine emperors bore the title "Flavius" and it's later Greek->Latin transliteration "Phlabios" ("Shabbos").

The origins of Christianity become clear when you realize that the Herodians, Alexandrian elites, and the Flavians were the same incestuous (78) Jewish family who used over a dozen aliases, agnomens, regional/ethnic names, and different biographies and mythologies for each persona (79).  
  
**9.2. Alexandria, Egypt. 1st Century**

Emperor Caligula and his Prefect of Roman Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus (the real-life Pontius Pilate) (80), most likely became aware sometime around the Alexandrian Riots in 38CE that jews in Alexandria, in conjunction with the Alexandrian School, were trying to usurp the Romans through a revolution that weaponized the slaves and lowest classes. He then killed Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II and imprisoned his son Alexander (grandson of King Herod). This led to Philo's embassy to Rome in 40CE (81). This family then used their connections in Rome and money to bribe the Praetorian Guard to kill Caligula as revenge. Both of Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's death and eventually succeeded Aulus Avilius Flaccus as the Prefect of Roman Egypt. This group achieved their coup when Vespasian became emperor.  

A stylometric and textual analysis can trace the earliest (82) Koine Greek written (83) New Testament epistles back to the Alexandrian School in Egypt and Philo of Alexandria, but the actual conspiracy to use a slave morality religion to destroy civilizations traces back to a group of jewish high priests in Babylon and their slave morality system successfully took down the mighty civilizations and races of Babylon, Persia, Egypt, India, Rome, and eventually, all of Europe.  
  
\*Note on Vespasian's rise to power. Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander were personally responsible for the overthrow of Caligula \[link\], Nero, Galba, Otho, and they paved the way for Vespasian’s accession as the founder of the Flavian dynasty. Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's death. Before his death Nero is quoted as saying that followers of Chretus started the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD) (Tacitus, Annals XV. 44). The burning of Rome was part of the coup to install the crypto-jewish Flavian family into power. Vespasian, going by the alias 'Flavius Scaevinus', was directly involved in this conspiracy to overthrow Nero and burn Rome. Also, in July 69 CE Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander declared their allegiance to Vespasian and persuaded their legions to follow him. This was a crucial move that gave Vespasian a strong base of support in the eastern part of the empire. Tiberius Julius Alexander also sent money and troops to Vespasian’s allies in Italy and Africa and helped to secure the loyalty of other provinces and governors. Essentially, they used social engineering, bribery, and a slave morality religion to overthrow Rome, then, like in Egypt under the Hyksos and Babylonia and Persia under Cyrus the Great, they flooded Rome with foreigners to destroy group cohesion and cause tribal conflict with them ruling over the chaos.

Feudalism was invented simultaneously as institutional Christianity. Both by Constantine, one to enforce the other and vice versa, and this system was overseen by a 'Court Jew' \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Jew)\]. Because christianity banned money lending for Christians it allowed the jews to create monopolies in finance and become even richer than kings \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_of_Lincoln)\].  
  
**APPENDICES**  

**Appendix A**  
How did christianity spread? Vespasian and his sons Titus and Domitian brought 100,000 jewish "slaves" to Rome (Josephus, Jewish War vi, 9) (84). It seems likely that the 100,000 jewish "slaves" joined the jews that were already in Rome and they became the early church missionaries and profited from selling this religion to the slaves and exploited classes.  
  
**Appendix B**  
The jews were expelled at least three times from Rome after being accused of missionary efforts/co-opting Roman religions and making them jewish (85). In 139 BC they were expelled by Gnaeus Cornelius Hispanus for "corrupting the cult of "Jupiter Sabazius". They were then expelled in 19 AD by Tiberius, and in 41 AD by Claudius. Claudius in his letter of warning to the Jews in Egypt (preserved in a papyrus in the British Museum, P. Lond. 1912) described them as "the fomenters of a universal plague.".

Budge, 1886: c. xxxvii. p. 81) we read, "The Prophecy of Zaradosht concerning our Lord. This Zaradosht is Baruch the scribe." The prophecy is uttered to the disciples of Zaradosht, the King Gushnasp (Hystaspes) and Sasan and Mahmad. The Virgin-birth, crucifixion, descent into hell, resurrection, ascension, and second coming are predicted, and in answer to a question of Gushnasp, Zaradosht says, "He shall descend from my family. I am he and he is I; he is in me and I am in him."

\[39\] Simon was also "Simon the Essene" the founder of the Essene sect and "Simon Peter" in the bible? The term "Peter" is derived from the Latin "Pater" meaning "father," denoting the Essene High Priest. The Essenes called themselves "the Sons of Zadok" and Simon was the heir of the Zadokite (High Priest) dynasty. One of Simon's sons used the title Zadok as his name (Josephus: Antiquities 18:1:1). Sadduc (Sadducean) and Zadok are the same word rendered respectively the Greek way and the Hebrew way in our alphabet. The Sons of Zadok are a family of priests (kohanim) that descended from Zadok and are the upper echelons of Judean society. Also, Ha-Simeon = Hasmoneans. The Kohanim were entrusted with carrying the Torah and other jewish writings and their status transferred from father to son.

\--The name "Simon" probably denoted that he was of the tribe of Simon/Simeon

\--In Hebrew, the house of Onias is "Beit Honniyah".

\--The name "Boethus" is a misrecorded name from oral tradition. It was Bayztus originally, or bar YZT or bar Izates. YZT being the original Aramaic and Izates a Greek sounding variant. It meant "Yakov zu Tolomy" or Jacob aka Ptolemy.

\--Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) father Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II was supposed to have been killed by his father Herod, but this is obviously untrue. Josephus even has a story about a "spurious Alexander" that showed up in Rome claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death \[link\]. Alexander (son of King Herod) was executed by Caligula (probably for spreading the psyop religion)

\--Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II was also "Monobazus" who was the king of the Parthian client state of Adiabene in the 20s and 30s of the 1st century AD. This is why the Muslims refer to jesus as "Isa" or "Iza" and in the Yazadi (Izadi) religion the prophet is Sultan Ezid.

\--Matrilineally, Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister wife "Philo" descend from Mark Antony and Cleopatra. The Talmud says that Mark Antony was born to a jewish mother. His first wife Fulva was jewish, and Cleopatra was a Ptolemaic ruler and her family had a long history of intermarriage with Jews, so this family was almost fully jewish. The bust attributed to Mark Antony that is housed in the Vatican Museum was made over a century after he died during the Flavian dynasty. This: https://imgur.com/7RnVvRv is the only bust that is believed to have been made during his lifetime.

\--Alexander (grandson of King Herod) was the controller of the Egyptian gold mines, shipping ports and warehouses, at least 1/3 of the imperial Roman revenue went through him. He was also the administrator for the extensive land estates in Egypt owned by his aunt Antonia Minor (Emperor Claudius's wife, Emperor Augustus niece, and she was Mark Anthony's youngest daughter) (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 19.276).
