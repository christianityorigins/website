Chapter 2: Subversion of the Imperial Cult

Sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), a group of rabbis
that were headed by a rabbi named Akiva who lead the Talmudic Pharisees
and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer Yetzirah (book
of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and modern judaism,
and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle claimed that he was
brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)), and who
was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome was Edom", realized
that subversion was the only way to defeat the Romans. So, rabbi Akiva
and his students Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria
aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Simon ben Yohai (Justin Martyr?), Ketia bar
Shalom aka 'Clement of Rome' (hebrew Ketia is the same as Latin Clement), Aristo of Pella, who is a good candidate
for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or 'Ariston' is a name that is
related to 'Proteus' The former means 'first-rank, noble' the second
derives from 'first'. So, was he also Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or
Mahalia, sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem was the secretary of Aristo and
Marcion is known to have had a disciple named Lucanus as documented by
Tertullian, so Mark, or Mahalia, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was
also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope?) and Rabbi Meir aka Polycarp aka Bishop ignatius (Ignatius means firely one and Polycarp was famous for lighting himself on fire), added a slave-morality suicide cult to the imperial cult.

Many of rabbi Akiva's students and contemporaries had connections to the
Alexandrian School in Egypt and were themselves students of Philo of
Alexandria.

Rabbi Akiva was likely Paul the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 "Paul" claims to have been educated at the feet of Gamaliel who was the teacher of rabbi Akiva, and in Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul the Apostle and Paul called them “my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.

Quintus Tinnius Rufus (Turnus Rufus the Evil) was Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judaea who crucified Simon bar Kokhba and killed rabbi Akiva.

Getting people to abandon their religons for a new one is an almost impossible task, so instead, through religious syncrenism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established
religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. So, they just took
one of the Bosphoran/Roman imperial cults of the time and infused a slave morality into
it.

Endnotes (Chapter 2)

(a) Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria grew up in the Attis-Sabazios cult on Anatolia before traveling to Judea to study under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian School.

(b) Yohai is a nickname for yochai. The name Yochai means 'YHWAH is gracius' from the Hebrew word Yochanan sometimes transcribed as Johanan. Was he also Johanan the Alexandrian? This would place him in Alexandria at the same time as Markianos of Alexandria.
