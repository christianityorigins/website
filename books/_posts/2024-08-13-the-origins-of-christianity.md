Preface
------------------


Christianity is the culmination of calculated syncretism, subversion, and imperial manipulation, over several centuries, of a religion. That is why there is a extremely powerful psychological weapon at its core (See: 'Book II: Christianity as a Slave Morality Religion and its Modern Secularized Variants: A Jewish Conspiracy and Hoax on the Gentiles').

The early rulers of Sumer were all priests. In Egypt, the Pharaohs were the actual sons of gods. The Persians copied this formula of deifying their leaders but took it a step further by turning their imperial cult into a slave-morality religion as part of their colonial program (Zoroastrianism and Buddhism), and then the Greeks and Romans followed this formula. Religious syncreticism and slave-morality religions that stripped the population of their will to power is how the imperial powers maintained their empire and prevented any rebellion. Christianity is a relic of one of these imperial slave moralities.

Over two millennia ago, the term 'Jew' denoted the Iudii or Iudaei, a Celtic tribe whose religious practices were rooted in Druidism. The Greek Ptolemaioi at the Alexandrian School in Ptolemaic Egypt sought to bring this group under their control and assimilate them by incorporating Hellenistic elements into their religious beliefs which lead to the creation of what was the first draft of Judaism. Subsequently, a few centuries later, the Romans replicated this strategy of subversion by further undermining the already transformed religious framework of the Jews through the imposition of the Roman imperial cult, specifically, the Flamen Dialis cult or the cult of the Divine Julius. The jewish storm god Baal-Hadad (Baal, meaning lord, while Hadad was specifically revered as the god of rain, thunder, and storms) then became I(J)upiter (who was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, or Yahweh), and their Moshiach (Messiah) was reinterpreted as Julius Caesar, I(J)upiter-Zeus (I-Zeus-> Izeus-> Iseus).

Then, sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), a group of Romans that included Gamaliel/St. Gamaliel aka Tiberius Gemellus who was a grandson of Emperor Tiberius and a cousin of Emperor Caligula, a Rabbi named Akiva (Epictetus?), Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos who was a nephew of emperor Hadrian, Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope, Simon ben Yohai, Ketia bar Shalom aka Titus Flavian Clemens who was a cousin of the emperor Domitian aka 'Clement of Rome', Rabbi Meir who was the grandson of emperor Nero, and Pliny the Younger aka Bishop Ignatius of Antioch aka Polycarp (likely also Paul the Apostle), and all of them working on behalf of emperor Hadrian, tried to subvert this group further by adding a slave-morality to the slave-morality religion.

After a year of research, I have concluded that much of what we know of history from antiquity and earlier was fabricated by the Church Fathers, Jesuits, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and medieval forgers, either to retrofit history to align with the Bible, due to conflicts between the Vatican and the Eastern Byzantine Church, or for profit. Consequently, my research methodologies are multifaceted, encompassing revisionist historiography, counter-narrative analysis, and historical deconstruction. The primary sources that inspired my research are listed in the 'Further Reading' section at the end of the book.

Ancient Alias Names List
---------------------

-   Alexander (son of King Herod and grandson of Simon Boethus) = Juba
    II who was married to Cleopatra Selene II (daughter of Mark Antony
    and Cleopatra VII) aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Alexander and his
    wife were adopted by Julius Caesar and raised in Rome.
-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod and great-grandson of Simon
    Boethus) = (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
    Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
    father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
    Cleopatros) aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka Alexander the
    Alabarch.
-   Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
    Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia =
    Philo of Alexandria, the sister-wife of Alexander (grandson of King
    Herold). She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary 'Pallas', and
    'Antonia Caenis' who was Vespasian's first cousin and mistress.
-   Bartholemew ('Bar Ptolemy') = son of Simon Boethus.
-   Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator, Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of
    Egypt = Dynamis Ourania, Queen of Bosphorus.
-   Eleazar ben Boethus = Lazarus of Bethany, son of Simon Boethus.
-   Gamaliel/St. Gamaliel (Paul's teacher) = Tiberius Gemellus, grandson
    of Emperor Tiberius and a cousin of Emperor Caligula. (The Aramaic
    word Gemel means "twin", in Latin it is Gemellus, and in Hebrew it's
    Gamaliel). He was a student of Herod Agrippa who was King Herod's
    grandson (Antiquities of the Jews, Flavius Josephus. Chapter 6).
    Gamaliel was the father of Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben
    Sapphias who was also King Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of
    Adiabene.
-   Gautama Buddha = Gaumata Bardya, son of Cyrus the Great.
-   King Herod = Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV
    of Parthia's regional alias.
- Josephus = Hegesippus.
-   Julius Caesar = Asander, Philocaesar Philoromaios, King of
    Bosphorus.
-   Marcion of Sinope = Markianos of Alexandria. Markianos of Alexandria's biography claims that he grew up in the Attis-Sabazios cult before traveling to Judea to study under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian School.
-   Mariamne Boethus = Mary Magdalene, daughter of Simon Boethus, fifth
    wife of King Herod, mother of Alexander (son of King Herod),
    grandmother of Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and Cleopatra IX
    aka Helene aka "Philo of Alexandria".
-   Mark Antony = King Herod aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV
    of Parthia.
-   Martha Boethus = St. Martha of Bethany, daughter of Simon Boethus
    and she was married to Judean high priest Joshua 'Jesus' ben
    Gamla/Gamaliel who was the son of Gamaliel.
-   Matthias the Apostle = Matthias Boethus, son of Simon Boethus.
-   Emperor Nerva = Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius Piso
    aka Arrius Varus who was the great-great-grandson of Simon Boethus
    and the son of Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his
    sister/wife Cleopatra IX aka Philo of Alexandria.
-   Onias I = heir of the Zadokite (High Priest) dynasty and a direct
    descendant of Joshua the High Priest and Zadok who was a descendant
    of Aaron who was the elder brother of Moses.
-   Onias II = Simeon the Righteous aka Simeon the Just aka Shimon
    HaTzaddik who was the Kohen Gadol High Priest.
-   Onias III = Qumran Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.
    'The Anointed One' which in Hebrew is 'moshiach' and often
    translated as 'messiah'. In Greek, 'The Anointed One' is
    Chréstos/Christ.
-   Paul the Apostle = likely a composite character or an avatar/cipher. Four suspects for having taking on the character are: 1)Saulus ben Antipater who was the
    son of Antipater/Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, grandson of King Herod
    (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Chapter 9, section 211),
    great-grandson of Simon Boethus, brother of Costobarus, 2)Saulos Thaddeus Alexander
    Herod, another grandson of King Herod, 3)Rabbi Akiva (Epictetus?), 4)Pliny The Younger. The character
    Paul/Saul's life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story
    'Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor'. Josephus in Antiquities of the
    Jews, Book XX (CH 9.4) refers to Paul (Saulus) as related to Herod
    Agrippa.    -
-   Pliny the Younger (Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus) = Bishop Ignatius of Antioch ('-natius' in Latin refers to 'youth'). He was also Polycarp (Ignatius means 'fiery one' and Polycarp was famous for setting himself on fire). Likely also Paul the Apostle (either him or Rabbi Akiva (Epictetus)). He was also Pope Linus (just drop the P from his name Plinius).
-   Pontius Pilate = several options. The historical record from antiquity has a repeating narrative of jewish high priests being executed by a Roman prefect or governor: Roman Procurator of Judea Lucceius Albinus condeming Jesus ben Ananias to cruxification; Roman Procurator of Judea Quintus Tineius Rufus aka Turnus Rufus the Evil condeming Simon bar Kokhba to cruxification;  Roman prefect (governor) of Roman Egypt Tiberius Julius Alexander condemining Judas the Gaulanite to death; Roman prefect of the Praetorian Guard Marcius Turbo condeming Lukuas Andreas to death; Roman prefect (governor) of Roman Egypt Aulus Avillius Flaccus crucifying many prominant jews in Alexandria, etc. Every one of these characters fit the Pontius Pilate role. I believe that royal elites role-played as if they were characters in a play, and these fictional deaths were story patterns or archetypes that were emulated. They killed off one character then assumed the role of another one in a different location. For example, Aulus Avillius Flaccus was also Polemon II of Pontus which was the regional alias of Emperor Titus. The character of Aulus Avillius Flaccus dies at the same time Polemon II of Pontus takes power and then Polemon II of Pontus dies around the same time Titus becomes emperor. They were all married to the same woman, Berenice, grandaughter of King Herod.
-   Simon Boethus (great-great-great? grandson of Onias III and heir of
    the Zadokite line) = (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus
    aka Simon Magus. Likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the
    Essene sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is
    derived from the Latin 'Pater' meaning "father," denoting the Essene
    High Priest. The Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and
    Simon was the heir of the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). After
    Hellenization many jews adopted Greek names. Matthew became Menelaus
    in honor of the celebrated husband of Helen, etc., so was he
    St. Matthew as well?
-   St. Mark = Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope or Marcus
    Julius Agrippa II, King Herold's grandson.
-   St. Peter = Publius Petronius (father-in-law of emperor Vitellius
    who I identify as Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus
    below).
-   St. Veronica = Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod, wife of
    emperor Titus (Veronica is the Latin alteration of the Greek name
    Berenice).
-   Titus Flavian Clemens = 'Clement of Rome'.
-   Emperor Titus = Aulus Avillius Flaccus, the prefect (governor) of
    Roman Egypt (Egyptian alias), and Polemon II of Pontus. Polemon II
    became the king of Pontius the same year (38AD) that Aulus Avillius
    Flaccus was alleged to have been sent to Ponza island to be killed
    (see: Philo's embassy to Caligula (38CE)). Polemon II of Pontus was
    married to King Herod's granddaughter Berenice who eventually
    married emperor Titus. Berenice was also married to King Herod's
    grandson/Julius Caesar's adopted grandson and her cousin, Herod,
    King of Chalcis. Titus who also Herod, King of Chalcis, the
    great-great-grandson of King Herod (The Royal Ancestry of Emperor
    Vespasian (The Royal Ancestry of Emperor Vespasian. Henry Davis,

    [[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)]).
-   Vespasian = Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King
    Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Great-grandson of King Herod.
-   Vitellius = Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus.
    Great-grandson of King Herod.

Speculative

-   Alexander the Great = Chandragupta (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized
    translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in
    Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). (See: 'Alexander and
    Chandragupta in Sanskrit Drama' by Ranajit Pal
    https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA
    [[link](https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA)])
-   Diodotus I Soter = Ashoka the Great. (See: 'Diodotus I was Ashoka'
    by Ranajit Pal
    https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi
    [[link](https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi)])
-   "Piso" cognomen = "Appius" is a cognomen (personal name) of the Claudian family. Appius and Piso are synonymous. The name Piso itself would be a form of Peisistratos/Pisistratos, the leading name of ancient Athens in Greece. (Pisistratos is a Latinized spelling of the Greek Peisistratos.) It could be said that all the ruling elite of the Julio-Claudian dynasty were "Piso's", including Nero who was nearly deposed by a Piso. Appius is also cognate with "Arrius".
-   Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator = Gaius Octavius aka Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, son of Julius Caesar and Berenice IV aka Alfidia (Cleopatra VII sister).
-   Rabbi Akiva (c. 50–135) = Epictetus (c. 50–135)? Epictetus was the slave to Nero's scribe Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus or Epaphroditos (c. 20–25 – died c. 95). Epictetus had a Roman teacher named Gaius Musonius Rufus (c. 20-30-died c. 101) who was a Roman Stoic philosopher. Gaius Musonius Rufus was also a teacher of Dio Chrysostom (c. 40 – c. 115 AD). Josephus opened his book 'Jewish Wars' and 'History of the Jews' (Antiquities) by addressing them to: "kratistos (most excellent) Epaphroditus". Rabbi Akiva also likely took on the role of 'Paul the Apostle'. (Akiva and Epictetus were born and died on the same date, and Epictetus had a hand in writing the new testament. See: 'Epictetus and the New Testament' by Douglas Simmonds Sharp (1914)). Epicteus and Pilny the Younger were both in the same places at the same time; Rome, Nicopolis, and Bithynia-Pontus, and Pliny the Younger was a Roman administrator in Bithynia and Pontus at the same time Marcion was in Sinope.
-   Zoroaster = Baruch ben Neriah. Scribe of Joshua the High Priest
    (possibly the same person).

BOOK I. THE ORIGINS OF CHRISTIANITY
----------------------------------------------

### Chapter 1: The Creation of Christianity

Throughout antiquity, from the pharaohs of Egypt to the emperors of
Persia and Rome, religion served as a key instrument of imperial
control, using syncretism to create a compliant population that served
the interests of the ruling elite. These elites employed religion, as well
as an incredible number of regional aliases, locations, fictional
stories, faked adoptions, and fabricated deaths for their family members to control the
population. They role-played as deities, religious figures, and
various characters as if they were actors in a play. This was done to obscure the fact that the people were ruled by hereditary dictatorships and to give the population an illusion of upward social mobility or implanting a sense of false hope. It is impossible for any religion to have have sprug up organically. The royal families controlled the dissemenation of religious texts, and the punishment for spreading a religion that might compete with an imperial cult was death.

The figure of Jesus Christ (of Nazareth) was a literary creation of these elites, incorporating elements of various historical and mythological figures to appeal to a wide audience. This character then became an avatar for several historical figures in an imperial cult.

Julius Caesar was the first 'Jesus' (I(J)upiter-Zeus (I-Zeus-> Izeus-> Iseus)). The Romans used a system called 'interpretatio romana' to associate their gods with local ones as part of their colonial program. Julius Caesar, as the claimed 'son of I(J)upiter' (there was no J in Latin) would have been Iupiter-Zeus to let the Greeks know that Iupiter and Zeus were equivalent deities (Roman Jupiter and Greek Zeus both derive from the Aryan skyfather 'Dyeus Pter'. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of Dyeus, and Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter'). Then subsequent emperors took on this role. I-Zeus (Izeus) eventually phonetically shifted to I-zas/Izas/Izates.\

#### 1.1 Imperial Cult

There was a Byzantine [^1] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^2] took
on the role of Asander, King of Bosphorus [^3] (the city of Byzantine,
later called Constantinople and now Istanbul was/is located in the area
called Bosphorus), and his wife Cleopatra used the regional alias of
Dynamis Ourania [^4] (translates to 'heavenly power'), queen of Bosporus

![Fig.1.1](/images/caesarasander.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.1. (L) Asander, King of Bosphorus, (R) Julius Caesar 

![Fig.1.2](/images/Cleopatra%20VIIDynamis.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.2. (L) Dynamis, Queen of Bosphorus, (R) Cleopatra VII. There was obviously many years in between the ages that she was depicted, however, even in the elder Dynamis bust you can see her lazy eye and abnormally large eyes which she was reported to have had, possibly as a consequence of inbreeding. 

![Fig.1.3](/images/cleopatra.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.3. (L) Julia Mamaea, Queen of Pontus (wife of Polemon II), (R)
Cleopatra VII. Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus was Julius Caesar/Asander's
regional alias (Asander and Polemon were both married to Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She
would have been married to her half-brother (Cleopatra and Mark Antony's son) Polemon II, King of Pontus
aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom,
also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next
to the Pontus Kingdom

Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who carried the title
'King of Kings'. Her uncle was Mithridates 'Chrestus'[^5].

Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen
(Jesus Amen of Rev. iii. 14) [^6] was married to Stratonice who was the
sister of Asander. He was also a cousin of Dynamis.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Julius Caesar aka Asander = Tiberius
Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios, who was born about the same time as
Caesarion.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony [^7](aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander Helios
aka Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his
twin sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is most likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal ('Helio' and Celtic 'Hesus' both derive from the
Proto-Indo-European root 'sawel-', meaning 'sun', and 'Selene'
translates to 'moon' in Greek).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Ptolemy
Philadelphus who was Sampsiceramus I?

Mark Antony's (aka King Herod aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) son with Livia Drusilla = emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus (one way to make this connection and prove his King Herod and Tiberius Claudius Nero aliases is through the equivalence of Doris the first wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of Octavius/Caesar Augustus. Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but was divorced and he became engaged to Livia Drusilla (Doris), who was at the time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor of 62 BC).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the 'King of Kings') aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria'.

Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister wife Cleopatra (Thea
Philopator) of Mauretania had two sons: Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys (In Thracian, "Cotys" is related to the word "kotys" which is a title that means "lord") aka
Emperor Nerva, and Marcus Julius Alexander aka Yeshua Cleopatros
(Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ma'nu of
Adiabene/Edessa aka Ptolemy aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy aka Izates aka Jesus
Emmanuel aka Monobazus of Adiabene [^8]

![Fig. 1.4](/images/coin-abgar-phraates.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.4. (L) and (R) show King Izates Monobazus of Edessa (known in
Greek as the 'Kingdom of Ourania' or in English as the 'Kingdom of
Heaven') wearing a crown of thorns. Izates or Izas is his title which is
an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning "lord". He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image
source: The Alexander Mosaic, Huqoq, Israel.

![Fig.1.5](/images/SauromatesII.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.5. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus, who was the
son of Tiberius Julius Cotys (aka Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius
Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Emperor Nerva), great-grandson of
Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Does he look familiar? ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ in the above coin translates to "King of the Sauromatians". Sauromates
is a Greek rendering of "Sarmatian", refering to the Scythian tribe who came from the Pontic steppe. "Saur" means "lizard" or "reptile", and "mates" means "man" or "warrior". Therefore, translated literallly ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ means "King of the lizard people", or "king of the reptile people". The Sarmatians were known for their use of scale armor, and this is where the reference comes from. 

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed
above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the "Sons of Ptolemy"), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc. and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^9]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy X Alexander I/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesars life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^10],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, 'Antiquities of the Jews', Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^11], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

It is likely that each Roman emperor after Julius Caesar took on the I(J)upiter-Zeus [^12] ('I-Zeus' -> Iesus) role as an avatar, which is why I identify many prominent Romans as having contributed to the bible (e.g. Titus Flavian Clemens aka 'Clement of Rome').

Then, after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), this imperial slave-morality cult was subverted by a confederation
of rabbi's who were headed by a rabbi named Akiva.

#### 1.2 The Cult of Antinous and the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE)

During the Bar Kokhba revolt a Rabbi in jerusalem named Akiva ben Joseph
(the name Akiva is related to Jacob/James) who lead the Talmudic
Pharisees and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer
Yetzirah (book of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and
modern judaism, and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle
claimed that he was brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel"
(Acts 22:3)), and who was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome
was Edom", preached that Simon bar Kokhba ('bar Kozeva' = 'son of the
star' in ancient Hebrew) was the 'messiah' during the Bar Kokhba revolt.

Two years before the Bar Kokhba revolt emperor Hadrian created a
religion to deify his underage gay lover as the son of god
(Osiris-Antinous) called 'The Cult of Antinous' [^13]. Historian Cassius
Dio claims that Antinous was offered as a human sacrifice to Hadrian
[^14] and later was 'resurrected'. The Cult of Antinous actually rivaled
christianity as the biggest cult in the empire for a couple of
centuries. One of the scribes for this cult was Aquila of Sinope aka
Onkelos who was a kinsman of the Roman emperor Hadrian. The midrash
(Tanhuma. 41a, Mishpatim 3) claims that Onkelos was a nephew of Hadrian
and other jewish sources list him as a nephew of emperor Titus (Tractate Gittin (56b)). Emperor
Hadrian also employed Aquilla of Sinope to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia
Capitolina after the Bar Kokhba revolt (the city was named after Hadrian's family name (Aelia) and the Roman god Jupiter (Capitolina)). Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos was a student of none other
than rabbi Akiva. In Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed
that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul
the Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus"
[^15].

Rabbi Akiva's other students included Markianos of Alexandria aka
Marcion of Sinope [^16] and Shimon bar Yochai. Another student of
rabbi Akiva was Aristo of Pella, who is a good candidate for being Luke
the Evangelist ('Aristo', or 'Ariston' is a name that is related to
'Proteus' The former means 'first-rank, noble' the second derives from
'first'. So, was he also Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or Mahalia,
sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem was the secretary of Aristo and Marcion is
known to have had a disciple named Lucanus as documented by Tertullian,
so Mark, or Mahalia, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also
Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope?). One other student of
rabbi Akiva was Ketia bar Shalom which was the jewish name of Titus
Flavian Clemens, who was the nephew of emperor Domitian [^17]. Titus
Flavian Clemens is a likely candidate for being 'Clement of Rome'. Rabbi
Akiva's other student was Rabbi Meir who the Talmud (Gittin 56a) claims
was a grandson of emperor Nero.

'The Secret Gospel of Mark' [^18] which speaks about Jesus's
homosexuality and the Cult of Antinous came out about the same time. It
is possible that the Gospel of Mark was written by Markianos of
Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope for the Cult of Antinous and was
grafted on to the Roman imperial cult, or Markianos of Alexandria aka
Marcion of Sinope and other scribes at the Alexandrian School in Egypt
used the imperial cult as the foundation for the Cult of Antinous and
this became christianity. It is possible that this group was trying to
subvert the imperial cult multiple times before but the Bar Kokhba
revolt was the sign that ideological subversion was the only way to
overthrow the Roman empire. Getting people to abandon their religons for
a new one is an almost impossible task, so instead, through religious
syncrenism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established
religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. So, they just took
one of the imperial cults of the time and infused a slave morality into
it.

This conspiracy was so elaborate that this group even rewrote history to
make it fit with their new religion. Josephus was an alias for
Hegesippus [^19] (the name Hegesippus is most likely a Latin to Greek
corruption of 'Iosippus', the Latinized spelling of Josephus) who was
another person associated with the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt and who was possibly a student of rabbi Akiva. The book 'The Antiquities of the
Jews' was a pseudo-epigraphical work (of propaganda) that was backdated to make christianity look legitimate in the same way that the 'Letter of Aristeas' was backdated to exaggerate the age of the Septuagint. It was historical fiction. I would even hazard a guess that this group was
responsible for burining down the Library of Alexandria which resulted
in the loss of all recorded history up until that point so that they
could cover-up the tracks of their psyop religion which was primarily engineered at the Alexandrian School.

Endnotes (Chapter 1)

(a) The symbol of the cross, Celtic cross/high cross/sun cross/solar
    wheel, et.al., which predate christianity by thousands of years
    (Callanish Stones. Wikipedia,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones)]), was a
    prominant symbol in ancient Europe. The circle is a sunwheel that
    together with the cross served as a sundial that had markings to
    track the time, date, and lunar and agricultural cycles. Also, in
    portable form it was a sundial clock and compass. Although not a
    religious symbol, as they were astronomical tools, every city in
    ancient Europe would have had a large cross raised at its center in
    the same way that every city today has a clock tower at it's center.
    So you can see how christianity spread throughout Europe, through
    subversion. Most Europeans must have thought that christianity was
    simply the same relgion that they were already worshiping, and
    because of widespread illiteracy at the time, they had no idea what
    garbage was inside the bible.\

It is true that the area of modern-day Istanbul was once called 'Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn' ('Kingdom of the Romans') and the people of that region called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans). Fomenko also makes the claim that the original Biblical Jerusalem (the city of Yoros) is situated on the eastern shore of Bosphorus. My own research on the origins of Christianity take me to the Bosphorus as well (Julius Caesar = Asander, King of Bosphorus, and Cleopatra = Dynamis). So, maybe there is an element of truth in his theories?. \

### Chapter 2: The Origins of Judaism

To understand Christianity it is necessary to explain its precursors and
the context in which they were created.

#### 2.1 Ethnogenesis of the Jews

Modern day jews evolved from the mixture of Celtic Cimbri and Galatians from Anatolia [^20], Neolithic proto-Sicilians who originated in Anatolia [^21], native Canaanites (who were literal human-neanderthal hybrids) [^22], and proto-Arab-Natufian hybrids.

The original redhead clan of Druids that ended up becoming Israelites were Scythians who migrated southwards during the early Aryan invasion of 4000 BC. Scythian --> Saka --> Isaac. This migration coincides with the development of early bronze age civilization. They went to Anatolia first (Galatia) [^23], then Babylon, then Canaan ('Gaulinitis' = Golan Heights). In Canaan, the natives then came under the suzerainty of these Celts and their entire identity, language, and religion derives from this. The evidence for this is paternal DNA assays (Celtic R1b haptype is present in 20% of ashkenazi jews, other common paternal haplotypes are J2 (17% of ashkenazi), I (4% of ashkenazi) , R1a (10% of ashkenazi)), the fact that the Celtic languages are surprisingly Semitic with a verb-subject-object word order and a shocking amount of vocabulary overlap, and the name of Irish deities, Balor and his holiday Beltaine are cognate to Bal and Elatha the Irish Uranus is cognate to Hebrew El. There was an ancient Celtic conquerer named 'Ram the Druid' and Abraham = Ab Ram, or 'Ab אֲב (father) of Ram', he was also Ra in Egyptian mythology, the basis of the name 'Ram'esses in Egypt, Ram the Aries, Rama in the Vedas, Brahmin caste in India refers to him, and Lama in Tibet. King David (DWD) = King Druid. The name Israel itself is named after Osiris (Aesir), the southeasternmost grand Druid (in Phoenician, the name 'Osiris' is written as 'Usr' or 'Ysr', which becomes the Hebrew 'Yisrael'. Osiris is depicted as having green skin, ie. he is the 'Druid green man'). As for the name 'jew', the descriptive name Judaism was never used by the Hebrews or Israelites; it appears only with Christianity. It comes from Yahud or Auda which comes from Iodh or Ioux. Iodh and Ioux are associated with the yew tree in Druidism and is sometimes linked to the concept of rebirth and regeneration. There was also an ancient Celtic tribe known as the Iudii or Iudaei, who inhabited the region of Gaul (modern-day France) and Britain. The ancient Celtic prefixes 'Rab' or 'Rhab' mean 'wise one' or 'seer', and a Druid equates to a Rabbi.

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts who called themselves Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who was Pythagoras's teacher, who was the son of Seuthes (Seth), shows this. The term Abaris was inspired by the Semitic Iber. Iber was sometimes rendered as Aber or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew languages. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for Ireland. The word Atlantis means ‘The Island of Atlas’. The titan Atlas was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the  bearer of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia, the Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas where the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.). Dionysius of Alexandria in Egypt (ca. 190-264 CE) also referred to the inhabitants of Britain as Iberi.

'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the ancient Akkadians [^24]. The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri, known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks. Cimmerians were a middle eastern offshoot of the Celtic Cimbri tribe. 

These Celtic males mixed with Neolithic Anatolian woman before their descendants moved into Egypt (Apiru or Habiru) and Caanan and then mixed with indigenous people in those places.

#### 2.2 The Myth of a Jewish People

All jewish history was made up. Their religion was Celtic Druidism that was Hellenized at the Library of Alexandria and then combined with the Divine Julius cult. So, ancient judaism (up to Rabbi Akiva) was a syncretic attempt by the Alexandrians and then Romans to pacify the jews (who were then Celts) [^25]. 

#### 2.2.1 Alexandria

It was in Alexandria at the Library of Alexandria where the Pentateuch and Septuagint were written. See: Chapter 7. The Alexandrian School. Sometime after 283-246 BCE (Ptolemy I Soter's reign) their religion (Druidism) was Hellenized. The myth of the jewish people and the Laws of Moses were based on Plato’s hypothetical colony of Magnesia from his thesis called The Laws (347 BC) in which the proposed charter for the Cretan colony of Magnesia was modeled in large part on Athenian legal and constitutional traditions. Ancestor received law from a deity, hereditary priesthood rather than king, as well as the division into 12 tribes were all part of the formula. Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) is where the story of Abraham comes from. Plato's Timaeus is also the source for Genesis 1-11. Homer's Odysseey was the source of Genesis 24, 42-46 [^26]. The biblical concept of hell was stolen from Plato's Replublic ('Myth of Er'), and the spiritual plane of Heaven is ripped off from Plato's 'World of Forms'. Exodus is just a semitized retcon of Jason and the Argonauts, and the Oracles Against the Nations plagiarize the Sibylline Oracles. The fact that their religion was extremely Hellenized in Alexandria shows that either the jews were trying to ingratiate themselves into the Greek speaking world (oecumene), or that they were so problematic of a population that the Greek 'Ptolemaioi' were trying to civilize and/or subjugate them with religion (child sacrifice of the firstborn on the 8th day at Gehinnom was replaced with circumcision, etc.).

#### 2.2.2 Romanization

Ceasar’s gentilice (surname) was Iulius. We are told by Virgil that it goes back to Ceasar’s supposed ancestor Iulus or Iule, after the ancient Celtic tribe known as the Iudii or Iudaei, who inhabited the region of Gaul (modern-day France) and Britain. I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus). Abel and Cain are just a copy of Romulus and Remus. Judas Iscariot is just a copy of Brutus. 

The Proto-Indo-European root for "Julius" (Iulius in Latin) is reconstructed as "yews", while the Proto-Indo-European root for "Jew" (Iudaeus in Latin) is also reconstructed as "yews". 'Gaius' in the name Gaius Julius Caesar refers to his tribal affiliation in the Gallian (Gauls (Galli = Celt in Latin)) tribe. Also, Caesar, Kaiser (German for Caesar), Kesar or Kaysar (Persian for Caesar), Kaisar (Ancient Greek for Caesar), Tsar (Russian for Caesar) and Khazar are not just phonetic coincidences. It all ties back to the Divine Julius cult. As explained in Chapter 1, Julius Caesar was a title, so Gaius Julius Caesar could conceivably translate to: King Jew of the Celtic tribe Galli. I.e., Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus (I-Zeus) was a Celtic deified king.

Paul's Epistle to the Galatians was sent to the Iudaei of Galatia. Galata in Classical Anatolia was settled by the Gauls. Galatia bordered the Bosphorus, and Julius Caesar/Asander was king of this region. The king of Galatia during this time was Asander's brother-in-law Amyntas of Galatia who ruled an area that streched into India under the alias Amyntas Nikator. 

Lucan's 'Pharsalia or De Bello Civili (On the Civil War)' mentions that the Gauls in Galatia worshiped a deity called Esus/Hesus/Iesus.

Suetonius, in 'Divus Julius' (84.:1) states that there were an inordinate amount of jews at Julius Caesars funeral and they even burned their jewellery in mourning. Josephus also frequently mentions the benefits conferred to jews by Julius Caesar (Anti. Jud. xiv. 14, 15, 16). 

This is why several descendants of Roman aristocrats described themselves as 'jewish' despite being ethnically Celtic Gauls or Aryan Sarmatians. For example, Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus/Ptolemy X Alexander I (Simon Boethus) played the role of judaen high priest, Mark Antony played the role of King Herod. Izates of Monobazus (Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias) and Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia (Jesus ben Fabus) played the role of rabbis, Tiberius Gemellus who was a grandson of Emperor Tiberius and a cousin of Emperor Caligula was rabbi Gamaliel/St. Gamaliel, Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos who was a nephew of emperor Hadrian, Titus Flavian Clemens who was a cousin of the emperor Domitian aka 'Clement of Rome' was Ketia bar Shalom, Rabbi Meir who was the grandson of emperor Nero, Philo of Alexandria was 'Philo the Jew', her brother-husband Tiberius Julius Alexander identified as Jewish, etc. 'Jew' at the time meant Celtic Druid of the Iudii or Iudaei tribe.

####  2.2.3 Shimon bar Yochai

Although judaism was an Alexandrian School attempt at subverting the jews religion to assimilate them (who at the time may have been primarily Celtic male - Neolithic Anatolian woman mixes, or at least governed by these people), and then a Roman attempt to subvert them by incorporating the Roman imperial cult slave-morality into their religion, I suspect that Shimon bar Yochai, who was one of the students and scribes of Rabbi Akiva, was something approximating a modern day Ashkenazi Jew and he is responsible for the Talmud, 'The Secrets of Shimon bar Yochai', and Islam.

In the book 'Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World' (1977) by Patricia Crone and Michael Cook they trace the origins of Islam to 'The Secrets of Shimon bar Yochai'. They theorize that Islam was started as a psy-op to weaponize the Arabs to attack the Byzantine empire (eastern Rome) to free judea. 

Shimon bar Yochai wrote that his "secrets" were revealed to him when he was hiding in a cave on account of the persecutions of Caesar king of Edom (Rome). His "secrets" were his blueprint for the destruction of Rome (Esau/Edom) and all western "gyrwn" (Aramic form of goyim) through using Ishmael (Arabs) and "four-arms" (Indians).

According to his prophecy, after "Ishmael" weakens Edom (Rome) and then "dies a noble death", the jews would import millions of "four-arms" ("Chaturbhuja" in Sanskri means "four-armed" and many Hindu deities are depicted with four-arms, including Vishnu) to dilute the Roman population and finish the job.

In Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai stated: "Kill the best of Gentiles, smash the head of the best of snakes". He was the biggest proponent of the belief that Rome was Edom.

King Izates of Monobazus's (Isa in the Quran) son was named 'Zamaris' (Zamaris the Babylonian jew?) and Zamaris has the same meaning as Muhammad. Allah and Muhammad the red-headed warlord were parodies of Attila the Hun and his uncle Ruglia waging war against Rome (Edom) because they wanted the Arabs to attack eastern Rome. So, did Rabbi Simon ben Yohai do a bait-and-switch and instead turned judaism in a group strategy while turning the Adiabene imperial cult into Islam to weaponize the Arabs? It is impossible to get people to abandon their religions for a new one, so he created a sect of one of the popular religions at the time and infused the trojan horse ideology into it.

#### 2.2.4 Modern Judaism

The area of modern israel was wiped out multiple times. Modern jews are a hodgepodge of ethnicities who survided the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE. Also, the religion of Modern judaism is a recent invention. Judaism is not the Torah (Old Testament), and has not been for a long time. The Talmud was completed after the New Testament and this is what modern jews follow. Essentially, jews follow the program that Shimon bar Yochai created.\

Endnotes (Chapter 2)

(a) Yohai is a nickname for yochai. The name Yochai means 'YHWAH is gracius' from the Hebrew word Yochanan sometimes transcribed as Johanan. Was he also Johanan the Alexandrian? This would place him in Alexandria at the same time as Markianos of Alexandria

### Chapter 3: The Origins of Zoroastrianism

Hippolytos (or: Hippolytus) was a Christian author who speaks of a legend involving the meeting of Pythagoras and Zoroaster of Persia. Aristoxenos, who was a student of Aristotle, wrote the same thing. Druidism was invented by Pythagoras or his teacher Abaris the Hyperborean [^27]. Vedism is the eastern branch of Druidism [^28].

Did Cyrus the Great aka Koroush Kabir (Koroush = 'lord of the sun, kabi = 'great'. Cyrus translates to Kurosh in ancient Persian) hire Pythagoras to create an imperial cult? Druidism, Judaism, Vedism, and Zoroastrianism all have similar themes.

Zoroastrianism is clearly a slave morality. All the troubling aspects of christianity originate in Zoroastrianism:
monotheistic deity that judges you when you die, eternal hell, universalism, sin/salvation, confession of sins, self-deification to weaponize/empower the lowest castes. Zoroastrianism also has a religious commandment called 'Xwedodah' that commands Zoroastrians to marry and procreate with their siblings, with punishment for not doing so!

#### 3.1 Zoroaster and Jewish Influence

Zoroastrianism would go on to influence every slave morality religion
that came later, including Buddhism and every one that came from the
Alexandrian School in Egypt, which was a Hellenic school to pump out
even more slave morality fiction to control the masses.

Endnotes (Chapter 3)

(a) In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus "The Anointed One" which in
    Hebrew is "moshiach", often translated as "messiah". In Greek "The
    Anointed One" is Chréstos/Christ or Soter. "This prophet, Cyrus,
    through whom were to be redeemed His chosen people, whom he would
    glorify before all the world, was the promised Messiah, 'the
    shepherd of Yhwh' (xliv. 28, xlv. 1)."\

### Chapter 4: The Origins of Buddhism

Gautama Buddha was Gaumata Bardya the son of Cyrus the Great who was the
one who spread Zoroastrianism. The Persepolis Tablets (PFS 79, PFS 796
and PF 250) which date from the time of Darius the Great are filled with
Buddhist iconography and tell a story that Darius the Great came to
power by overthrowing the "stargazer-Magus" Gaumata in Babylon [^29]. Gaumata
Bardya was the satrap (governor) of the Persian province of Bactra
(modern day Afghanistan).

Buddhism is a philosophy and religion that is focused on escaping
suffering. Central to this belief is the Four Noble Truths which
explain the cause of suffering (desire) and the path to ending it
(enlightenment through the Eightfold Path). Buddhism is clearly a
slave-morality that is designed to turn its followers into pacifists and
submissives and obviously benefited Gaumata Bardya and/or the
Greco-Bactrians that ruled Bactria. Buddhism and Zoroastrianism were forerunners of Christianity, both weaponized and state sanctioned slave moralities.

#### 4.1 Buddhism's Roots in Zoroastrianism

Symbolism, beliefs, and themes that originate in Zoroastrianism show up
in Buddhism. For example, Ahura Mazda has also been called Buddha Mazda,
specifically in Afghanistan where Buddhism was a major religion [^30].
There are also numerous overlapping customs, such as spiritual
initiation, vegetarianism, and the use of fire in worship. Both
religions also share similar prayer practices and ceremonies, such as
the veneration of ancestors and purification rituals.

#### 4.2 The Hellenization of Buddhism

After its inception, Buddhism was further influenced and spread by the
Greco-Bactrians. Pyrrho of Elis, who traveled to India with Alexander
the Great, created Bactrian Buddhism [^31]. This form of Buddhism was repackaged by Ashoka the Great (Diodotus I Soter) in India as a slave morality to subjugate the population.

### Chapter 5: Alexander the Great

Alexander the Great was an archetype for the Jesus figure. The jews
declared him a messiah, or "The Anointed One" (Chréstos/Soter)
(Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b) because he "liberated"
them from the Persians in 330 BC. Paradoxically, the Jews did the same
with Cyrus the Great when he in turn "liberated" them from the
Babylonians. The Jews also told Alexander the Great that the book of
Daniel was a prophecy about him (it wasn't, they wrote it after they met
him). The Book of Daniel "prophesied" of Alexander the Great of Greece
conquering the whole world even Israel. He was called the Ram of God by
Prophet Daniel and in Daniel 8:5-7 a male goat with a large horn between
his eyes suddenly arises from the west and smashes both horns of the
ram. The angel Gabriel tells Daniel this goat represents the kingdom of
Greece and its large horn is its first king,

#### 5.1 Alexander's Influence on Religious Thought

YHWH = Jehova = Jove (Yoweh is similar to Latin Iove) = Jupiter =
Ye-Zeus (YHWH + Zeus). Alexander claimed to be the son of Zeus
(Zeus-Amun, Zeus-Ahura Mazda, Zeus-Yahweh, etc.).

![Fig.
1.6](/images/Alexander.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.6. Alexander the Great as Zeus Ammon (or Jupiter Ammon), the ram
god. The Greeks had identified the Egyptian god Ammon with Zeus, the
Romans identified Ammon with Jupiter.

#### 5.2 Alexander as a Prototype for the Jesus Figure

Other similarities: according to the first-century A.D. historian
Plutarch, Alexander's mother Olympias told her son that he had been
conceived when a thunderbolt -- interpreted as Zeus -- entered her womb,
so he was divinely birthed. He died at 33. 'The Son of the Man' is a
Koine->Aramaic->Koine mistranslation of Alexander and he was the "King
of Kings" [^32].

Endnotes (Chapter 5)

(a) Alexander indirectly became the Jesus prototype. Julius Caesar
    called himself the Roman Alexander and stole a lot of Alexander's
    mythology for his religion called the Divine Julius Cult which was
    plagiarized to make Christianity more appealing to the Romans. See:
    Chapter 9. Rome.\
(b) A non-mainstream version of history, but one that is recorded in
    Persian and Islamic sources [^33], is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince (Bupares) who was the son of Kai Bahman (Artaxerxes
    II Memnon), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon' [^34]
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'. He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta (Alexander is Iksander in Persian and
    "Alakshandra" in Sanskrit and Gupta means 'guardian' or 'protector'
    in Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander). Evidence of this is
    that the Sanskrit language might be a dialect of Avestan, or a
    Hellenized variant of Avestan, and the similarities of customs and
    religions [^35]. Also, there is strong evidence that Alexander's
    successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, ruled India with the
    regional identity of Ashoka the Great [^36]. See: Alexander Romance
    [^37], The life of Alexander of Macedon [^38], and Alexander the
    Great: Beyond the Divide by Charles N. Pope [^39].\
(c) Alexander is also identified as the Islamic prophet Dhu al-Qurnayn
    (He of Two Horns). His name comes from coins depicting him as Zeus
    Ammon, a two-horned pagan god (see: Fig 1.6.).

### Chapter 6: Ancient India

#### 6.1 The Asuras and Jewish Influence

The earliest mention of the jews being in India is in the Indian
religions. They were the Asuras [^40] who were described as power
seeking demons [^41]. They probably moved east after the Assyrian
expulsion in 733/2 BCE. Then, several centuries later in the 3rd century
BC, Aristotle, quoting his pupil Clearchus who traveled to India, and
recorded in Josephus's Contra Apion, wrote that there were jewish
"priests" and "philosophers" in India in the 3rd century BC: "Jews are
derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians
Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their name from the country
they inhabit, which is called Judea.". Megasthenes (350 BC - 290 BC)
recorded the same thing: "the Jews were an Indian tribe or sect called
Kalani".

#### 6.2 The Aryan Invasion and the Evolution of Indian Religions

The Indus Valley civilization was founded by Neolithic (Med) people from
Iran (Harappan civilization). They mixed with R1a haplotyped Aryan
invaders from the Pontic Caspian Steppes [^42] who brought the Sanskrit
language and the ancient Vedas. Was it through the Scythian connection
that the jews moved into India? Or Cyrus the Great or his son Gaumata?
Or Alexander the Great? After Alexander, the jews had a Judean based
Qahal that stretched into Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Did it
stretch into India as well?

The Aryan invasion around 1500 BCE introduced new cultural and religious
ideas into the Indian subcontinent, leading to a blending of indigenous
beliefs with those of the incoming Aryans. This period saw the
foundation of Vedic texts, which were heavily influenced by the existing
cultural practices, including those brought by Jewish settlers.

The interactions between these groups led to a rich tapestry of beliefs,
with the Vedic tradition incorporating elements of Jewish thought,
particularly regarding morality and the nature of the divine. The
emergence of Hinduism was influenced by these syncretic processes, which
created a complex religious landscape characterized by myriad deities
and philosophical schools.

Endnotes (Chapter 6)

(a) A few authors have claimed that the Dravidians were Ethiopians that
    the jews imported to India via South India and Sri Lanka to work as
    slaves in the spice trade and in the marble mines (also to create
    tribal conflict with the Aryans). Importing them in large numbers
    from the south meant that they went undetected by the Aryans in the
    north. From Ethiopia it is a straight line route to Sri Lanka via
    boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves then mixed with indigenous Australoid/Denisovans
    who were similar to Australian Aborigines.\

    which explains how Babylonian jews were involved in the slave trade
    since the 6th century BC, even reaching India. An interesting fact
    is that the Radhanite, who owned the Silk Road trade, were their
    descendants. These Radhanite/Babylonian jewish slave traders would
    eventually go on to dominate the white slave trade of Eastern Europe
    and they were the ones who founded Khazaria in Eastern Europe as
    their base of operations (see: 'A Theory of Khazars and Ashkenazi
    Jews' by Pierre Simon. Occidental Observer. February 8, 2024). Their
    descendants went on to start/control the transatlantic slave
    trade. \
(c) Calami is a village located in the Kannur district of Kerala,
    southwest India. Kochi, also known as Cochin, is a major port city
    in the state of Kerala. Cochin is obviously phonetically related to
    the name Cohen (Kohanim/of the priestly Zadokite line).\
(d) "*it may be said that the region from Tigris-Euphrates to the Indus
    and its east was inhabited by the Akkadian speaking Semites who
    later called themselves as Asshuraiu. Their Indian name as known
    from Rgveda is *'*Asura*'" -- '*The Languages of Harappans*' by
    Maliti J. Shendge. In Aramaic the word Ashura means "tenth"
    referring to the tenth day of the month/Yom Kippur, the Day of
    Atonement.

### Chapter 7: The Alexandrian School

#### 7.1 The Role of the Alexandrian School in Religious Syncretism

Alexander the Great's successors ("Diadochi") were Seleucus I Nicator
who controlled a large chunk of the eastern territories, including
Mesopotamia and Persia, Diodotus I Soter who controlled Bactria
(possibly also India under the alias Ashoka the Great), and Ptolemy I
Soter who controlled Egypt. Following in the tradition of Alexander the
Great (Ptolemaic Cult of Alexander [^43]), the Seleucids (Mithraism
which was Zoroastrianism + slave morality), and the Bactrians
(Buddhism), Ptolemy I Soter created his own slave morality religion
called the Serapis Christus cult [^44] which was meant to bridge the gap
between the Greek and Egyptian cultures and subjugate the foreign
Egyptian people to his rule. This new god, Serapis, combined aspects of
Egyptian deities like Osiris and Apis  (Serapis = Osiris + Apis =
Osir-Apis = Ser-Apis) with Greek gods like Zeus, and had an Egyptian
body and Greek head.

#### 7.2 The Creation of the Septuagint and Its Impact

According to the Letter of Aristeas [^45] Ptolemy I Soter summoned 72
Babylonian Jewish high priests (kohanim) to Alexandria to translate the
Hebrew Bible. It was in Alexandria were these jewish priests wrote the
Pentateuch and Septuagint [^404]. It is possible to identify who some
of these jewish high priests were, and they were the descendants of the
Zadokite jewish high priests who created Zoroastrianism. Moreover, their
descendants were the ones who created Christianity.

In the book The Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus, Book XX, Chapter 10
[^46] he writes that Onias I was the leader of the Babylonian jews who
went to Egypt. Onias I was the heir of the Zadokite (High Priest)
dynasty that traces back to Joshua the High Priest. Baruch ben Neriah
was the scribe for Joshua and in the Old Latin Version of the Apocryphal
Book of Baruch (i. 1) it says that Baruch was of the tribe of Simeon
(same as Onias I). These Babylonian jews settled in an area of Egypt
that they called the 'Land of Onias' [^47] where they created a
sacrifice cult at the 'Temple of Onias' [46](#sdfootnote46sym). Josephus
also writes that Onias I was a friend of Alexander the Great
(Antiquities, Book. 8, section 7) and later Ptolemaic kings
(Antiquities, Book. 13, section 69) and it was through this connection
that this family not only were able to acquire land and protection but
eventually became aristocrats who married into the Ptolemaic dynasty
(Onias I was also the jewish high priest who tried to convince the
Spartan king Areus I that the Spartans were jews and promoted an
Abrahamic-Herculean syncretic religion to them [^48]).

The son of Onias I, Simeon the Righteous (aka Simeon the Just aka Shimon
HaTzaddik --  HaTzaddik ("the righteous one") obviously comes from Zadok
("righteous")), was the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) of Israel and one of
the last remnants of the Men of the Great Assembly [^49]. The Talmud
(Yoma 69a) claims that Alexander the Great "prostrated himself at the
feet of Simeon the Righteous". Then, to flatter Alexander, Simon the
Righteous named every son of jewish priests (kohanim) born that year
Alexander [^50]. Also, like Cyrus the Great, Alexander the Great was
declared a messiah, or "The Anointed One" (Chréstos/Soter) [^51] because
he "liberated" the jews from the Persians.

The son of Simeon the Righteous was Onias III, who was also an "Anointed
One" as prince according to Daniel Ch 9:25. Onias III was probably also
the Qumran Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The descendant and heir of Onias III, and the heir to the Zadok high
priest line, was Simon Boethus (great-great-great grandson of Onias III?
[^52]) aka Simon Magus [^53] aka Ptolemy Bar Mennius (Menelaus was the
name of the mythical founder of Sparta and this family adopted his name
[i](#sdendnote1sym), and "Ptolemy" signifies that this family had
intermarried with the Ptolemaic royal family by this point) who was the
creator of Gnosticism.

After the creation of the Serapis cult, the Alexandrian School then made
an industry out of taking existing religions and then adding to them a
psy-op slave-morality foundation. Manichaeanism, Valentinianism,
Buddhism [^54] Hermeticism (Philo of Alexandria's syncretic philosophy
to Hellenize the Canaanite religion of the Levant), and christianity
(slave morality targeted to Rome) all came from this school. The
Sibylline Oracles were a style guide for their students [^55].

Alexander the Great's Egyptian heir Ptolemy I Soter apparently shared
Alexander's esteem for the jews. According to Josephus (Antiquities,
Book. 12, chapters. 1, 2, pp. 308-309), and The Letter of Aristeas,
12,19, it is recorded that after Ptolemy I Soter took Judea he brought
120,000 Jewish captives to Egypt from the areas of Judea, Jerusalem,
Samaria, and Mount Gerizim. "Soter" in ancient Greek is similar to
Christios, i.e. "anointed one". Was he proclaimed a Christ and Messiah
by the jews like Cyrus and Alexander? Ptolemy I Soter's descendants also
obviously had a positive view of the jews because by Roman times the
Jews constituted 40% of the population of Alexandria [^56], and members
of this priestly jewish family carried Ptolemaic royal names.

    number until at the beginning of the Christian era they occupied
    two-fifths of the city and held some of the highest offices." ...

(b) Manetho in his book 'Aegyptiaca' wrote that the Hyksos or Habiru
    were lead by a priest named Osarseph and that Osarseph = Moses.
    Interestingly, Osarseph also = Ahmose Sipair or Serapis. The "Si"
    symbol in Si-pair, ie. "son of", is really "Ser". Also, pharaoh
    Thutmose who expelled jews to Jerusalem has been proposed as
    "Moses". Was the Serapis Cult invented by the same family of jewish
    high priests who invented Zoroastrianism as a way of connecting the
    Egyptian people to them and flattering Thutmose III and then was
    later retconned for Ptolemy Soter?

### Chapter 8: The Origins of Gnosticism

Platonism was the school of thought that started with Plato's teachings
and mixed Aristotle, Socrates, and Pythagoras into it. Neo-Platonism was
popular with the Roman elite. This is why Jews (especially in Alexandria
Egypt) wanted to infiltrate and subvert it with Gnosticism. 

#### 8.1 Simon Magus and the Creation of Gnosticism

Simon Boethius, a Jewish high priest and heir of the Zadokite dynasty
and a descendant of Joshua the High Priest, Baruch ben Neriah, and Onais
I, was Simon Magus who was the creator of Gnosticism ("gnosis", or
hidden knowledge) [^57]. The name Magus comes from Magi ("Simon the
Magi"), which was the name of the proto-Zoroastrian priests who
worshiped the evil brother Angra Mainyu more than the good brother
Ahura-Mazda, which comes from the twin-brothers Vedic gods Varuna-Mitra.
The theological bridge between Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism was likely
Manichaeanism or Mandaeism in which Simon was the prophet Mani in both
religions. Like Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism, Manichaeanism and
Mandaeism feature a dualistic worldview, but Manichaeism emphasizes
escaping the material world through knowledge ("gnosis") and good works,
and Mandaeans believe in one God of Light and revere John the Baptist.
Zurvanism, which was a determinist sect of Zoroastrianism, could be
another link between Zoroastrianism and Gnosticism. Unlike
Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism sees Zurvan, the god of infinite time, as the
ultimate source giving birth to twins Ahura-Mazda (good) and Angra
Mainyu (evil), just like the Demiurge in Gnosticism. This challenged
Zoroastrianism's free will concept, suggesting fate was predetermined.
Fundamental to both Zurvanism and Gnosticism is a dualistic view of the
world, with a good and evil force in constant conflict.

The central belief in Gnosticism is that god and life are evil and that
gnostic followers should not reproduce. It is an antinatalist suicide
cult to get the Greeks and Romans to reduce their populations while
raising them in a slave morality at the same time.

Simon was also Ptolemy Menneus [^58] and he was married to the Hasmonean
Princess Elizabeth of Jerusalem, Queen Alexandra II [^59] and his
daughter was Mariamne Boethus aka Alexandra Salome aka Mary Salome aka
Helena Of Adiabene [^60] (Helene was philologically interchangeable with
Selene and from there Salome) who was the fifth wife of King Herod.
Ptolemy Menneus was also Ma'nu II of Oshroene/Adiabene [^61].

Simon had a couple Gnostic sects that worshiped him: the Simonians
[^62], and a religion called Sophia [^63]. He was also likely the
prophet Mani in Manichaeanism and Mandaeism. The Nassenes [^64], who
were one of the earliest Gnostic sects, attributed divinity to Simon's
daughter Mariamne Boethus aka Mary Magdalene in xtianity [^65]. Simon's
other daughter Martha = St. Martha of Bethany who was married to Judean
high priest Joshua 'Jesus' ben Gamla/Gamaliel who was the son of
Gamaliel [^66] ("Paul the Apostle" claimed that he was brought up in
Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)) who was a grandson of
Hillel the Elder [^67] which would also connect Simon to the Mishnah and
the Talmud. Lazarus of Bethany = Eleazar ben Boethus, Simon's son,
another son was Bartholemew ("Bar Ptolemy"), and Matthias the Apostle =
Matthias Boethus, his brother. His great-grandson Saulos Thaddeus
Alexander Herod [^68] = Paul the Apostle? and his great-great
grandchildren Berenice = Saint Veronica (Veronica is the Latin
alteration of the Greek name Berenice) and Marcus Julius Agrippa II =
Marcus/Mark.

#### 8.2 Gnosticism's Influence on Early Christianity

Simon's line of descent to focus on is through his grandson Alexander
(son of King Herod) aka Juba II ("Iuba" is most likely a diminutive of
Iehuva, but "Iuba" also translates to "love" in the Berber languages of
Mauretania that he was king of exactly like "Philo" translates to "love"
in ancient Greek) who was Simon's grandson through his daughter Mariamne
Boethus [^69]. Alexander (son of King Herod) was married to Cleopatra
Selene II (daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII) aka Queen Thea
Muse Ourania. Alexander (son of King Herod) and Cleopatra Selene II were
both adopted by Julius Caesar and were raised in Rome (Julius Caesar and
Augustus adopted heirs of many royal families and got them to intermarry
because then every Roman client state would be ruled by a single family
and they would then be easier to control through proxy)).

Fig 1.7. (L) Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II. (R) Cleopatra
Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania

Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II had
two prominent children who were married to each other:

-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod) [^70] aka Gaius Julius Alexander,
    Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the
    Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch)
    Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka
    'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's father in the Talmud;
    Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or Cleopatros) aka Phraates
    IV (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of Adiabene. Alexander
    (grandson of King Herod) had over a dozen aliases [^71] and he was
    the richest man in the world at the time. Note how 'The Son of the
    Man' is a Koine->Aramaic->Koine mistranslation of Alexander and
    that as the grandson and heir of King Herod he was the 'King of
    Judea', 'King of the Jews'. Also, through his mother he was a
    descendant of the Egyptian Pharaohs, hence 'Son of God' [^72] as all
    Egyptian Pharaohs were called that. Like his ancestor Onias III and
    his adopted grandfather Julius Caesar Alexander (grandson of King
    Herod) used the title "Chrestus" ("anointed one") [^73]. He is also
    Jesus in the bible. He was married to his sister (see below).
-   Philo Judaeus of Alexandria ("Julius Philo", of the Julia gens
    [^74], because she was the adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar),
    which was an alias for King Herod's granddaughter (Salome III?) aka
    Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
    Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka
    Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Theophilus in the bible. She was also
    'Pallas' (as in the ancient Greek goddess 'Pallas-Athena' who in
    mythology frequently disguised herself as a man) [^75] who was
    Claudius and Nero's secretary, and 'Antonia Caenis' ('Caenis' was
    the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man), who was
    Vespasian's mistress [^76]

Endnotes (Chapter 8)

(a) Theory: Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania was also the Roman general 'Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo'. Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo conquered Armenia alongside Tiberius Julius Alexander (his son Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys aka Emperor Nerva), after which, Tigranes VI (Tiberius Julius Alexander) was instilled as king. Compare his bust [link] to the famous 'Josephus' (Tiberius Julius Alexander) bust [link]. Notice a resemblance? If this is correct, then he (Alexander) would have been the brother-in-law to Caligula and father-in-law to Domitian. Tiridates of Armenia (who would have been Mithridates Chrestus' great-great-grandson) was the one who spread the religion Mithraism which was a syncretic a slave-morality religion to subjugate the Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It’s a solar son deity, a Jupiter. 

### Chapter 9: Rome

Christianity is the combination of several religions and myths that were
amalgamated. The Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great, Serapis cult,
Roman imprial cult, Gnosticism, the Roman myth of Quirinus aka Romulus
[^77], the Divine Julius cult [^78], and the messianic archetypes of
Alexander the Great and Scipio Africanus [^79] who most ancient Roman
leaders, but especially Julius Caesar, modelled themselves after.

![Fig.1.9](/images/Denarius_C._Memmius_C._F._Romulus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.9. Romulus. He was born to a virgin, the son of god, hailed as a
King, crucified [^80] by a conniving elite and rose from the dead. See:
'Romulus' (75AC) by Plutarch.

#### 9.1 The Role of the Herodians in Rome

King Herod was the likely regional alias of Mark Antony (aka Tiberius
Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) [^81] and his descendants were
given an elevated position within Rome. They were raised in the same
household as Caesar Augustus [^82] and even became emperors.

Herodians in Rome to take note of:

Alexander (grandson of King Herod), who was the richest man in the world
at the time, and his sister wife Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka "Philo of
Alexandria" had two prominent sons:

-   Marcus Julius Alexander aka Gaius Calpernius Piso aka Izates bar
    Monobazus (aka Pliny the Elder?).
-   Tiberius Julius Alexander (Tiberius Julius Alexander's son was named
    'Philopappos' and one of his mothers recorded maiden aliases was
    'Alexandria bat Matthias' [^83] which is where the pseudonym 'Joseph
    bar Matthias' comes from. Also, drop the initial b and final s in
    the name "Bar Mathias" and you get (Joseph of) Arimathea) aka Arrius
    Calpernius Piso [^84] and Arrius comes from "Arrius Varus" [^85],
    one of his many alias, which in turn is probably a diminutive of his
    uncle's name Aristobulus) aka Emperor Nerva [^86].

![Fig.
1.10](/images/Josephus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.10. Erroneously identified 'Josephus' bust which I identify as
Tiberius Julius Alexander. Compare it to Nerva's depictions

Emperor Vespasian was another likely grandson of King Herod. He was
Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, son of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV
who was Julius Caesar's adopted son [^87] (ignore the elder busts of him
which have idealized Julio-Claudian features and look at his youngest
depictions [^88]. Vespasian was his title, not his name (Vas/Bas was the
royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pasius
= Peace. 'Vespasian' = 'King Peace'). He was also 'Flavius Scaevinus'
the conspirator who was involved in Nero's assassination. 'Philo of
Alexandria' aka Salome III was also 'Antonia Caenis' who was Vespasian's
first cousin and mistress and her son Tiberius Julius Alexander was
Vespasian's son-in-law/adopted son and the Prefect (leader) of the
Praetorian Guard which made him arguably the most powerful man in the
empire during Vespasian's reign. Philo of Alexandria aka Salome III was
also the first cousin and ex-mother-in-law to King Herod's granddaughter
Berenice aka St. Veronica (Veronica is a transliteration of the Greek
name Berenike meaning 'victory') who was empress of Rome through her
relationship with Vespasian's son Titus. Berenice's brother, Marcus
Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an incestuous relationship with [^89]
before moving on to her cousin, was the governor of all foreign Roman
territories except Egypt (which was governed by Tiberius Julius
Alexander) during the Flavian period..

![Fig.
1.11](/images/Vespasian.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.11. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesars adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister). He abdicated his position in favor of his younger brother.

So, five emperors in a row were King Herod's grandsons or
great-grandsons: Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva.

![Fig.
1.12](/images/emperors.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.12. Note how the Roman emperor phenotype changes dramatically
after Otho

Every Roman Emperor from Hadrian (likely an acronym for Herodian [^90]
onward descends from King Herod mainly through two women: Arria the
Younger and Cleopatra of Mauretania or Cleopatra IX ("Philo"), and by my
count 37 Roman and Byzantine emperors bore the title "Flavius" and it's
later Greek->Latin transliteration "Phlabios" ("Shabbos").

Fig. 1.13. (L) Constantius Chlorus. The father of emperor Constantine
(R) Emperor Flavius Constantine/Constantinus who carried the Flavian

The origins of Christianity become clear when you realize that the
Herodians, Alexandrian elites, and the Flavians were the same incestuous
[^91] family who used over a dozen aliases, agnomens, regional/ethnic
names, and different biographies and mythologies for each persona [^92].

9.2. Alexandria, Egypt. 1st Century

Emperor Caligula and his Prefect of Roman Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus
(the real-life Pontius Pilate) [^93], most likely became aware sometime
around the Alexandrian Riots in 38CE that jews in Alexandria, in
conjunction with the Alexandrian School, were trying to usurp the Romans
through a revolution that weaponized the slaves and lowest classes. He
then killed Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II and imprisoned his
son Alexander (grandson of King Herod). This led to Philo's embassy to
Rome in 40CE [^94]. This family then used their connections in Rome and
money to bribe the Praetorian Guard to kill Caligula as revenge. Both of
Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in
Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately
became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's
death and eventually succeeded Aulus Avilius Flaccus as the Prefect of
Roman Egypt. This group achieved their coup when Vespasian became
emperor.

A stylometric and textual analysis can trace the earliest [^95] Koine
Greek written [^96] New Testament epistles back to the Alexandrian
School in Egypt and Philo of Alexandria, but the actual conspiracy to
use a slave morality religion to destroy civilizations traces back to a
group of jewish high priests in Babylon and their slave morality system
successfully took down the mighty civilizations and races of Babylon,
Persia, Egypt, India, Rome, and eventually, all of Europe.

Endnotes (Chapter 9)

(a) Note on Vespasian's rise to power. Alexander (grandson of King
    Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander were personally
    responsible for the overthrow of Caligula [link], Nero, Galba,
    Otho, and they paved the way for Vespasian's accession as the
    founder of the Flavian dynasty
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Alexander#:~:text=While%20Prefect%20of%20Egypt%20(66–69)%2C%20he%20employed%20his%20legions%20against%20the%20Alexandrian%20Jews%20in%20a%20brutal%20response%20to%20ethnic%20violence%2C%20and%20was%20instrumental%20in%20the%20Emperor%20Vespasian%27s%20rise%20to%20power.%20In%2070%2C%20he%20participated%20in%20the%20Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20as%20Titus%27%20second-in-command.)].
    Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) sons were directly involved in
    Caligula's assassination and Tiberius Julius Alexander immediately
    became the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's
    death. Before his death Nero is quoted as saying that followers of
    Chretus started the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD) (Tacitus, Annals XV.
    44). The burning of Rome was part of the coup to install the
    crypto-jewish Flavian family into power. Vespasian, going by the
    alias 'Flavius Scaevinus', was directly involved in this conspiracy
    to overthrow Nero and burn Rome. Also, in July 69 CE Alexander
    (grandson of King Herod) and his son Tiberius Julius Alexander
    declared their allegiance to Vespasian and persuaded their legions
    to follow him. This was a crucial move that gave Vespasian a strong
    base of support in the eastern part of the empire. Tiberius Julius
    Alexander also sent money and troops to Vespasian's allies in Italy
    and Africa and helped to secure the loyalty of other provinces and
    governors. Essentially, they used social engineering, bribery, and a
    slave morality religion to overthrow Rome, then, like in Egypt under
    the Hyksos and Babylonia and Persia under Cyrus the Great, they
    flooded Rome with foreigners to destroy group cohesion and cause
    tribal conflict with them ruling over the chaos.

APPENDICES

Appendix A

How did christianity spread? Vespasian and his sons Titus and Domitian
brought 100,000 jewish "slaves" to Rome (Josephus, Jewish War vi, 9)
[^97]. It seems likely that the 100,000 jewish "slaves" joined the jews
that were already in Rome and they became the early church missionaries
and profited from selling this religion to the slaves and exploited
classes.

Appendix B

The jews were expelled at least three times from Rome after being
accused of missionary efforts/co-opting Roman religions and making them
jewish [^98]. In 139 BC they were expelled by Gnaeus Cornelius Hispanus
for "corrupting the cult of"Jupiter Sabazius". They were then expelled
in 19 AD by Tiberius, and in 41 AD by Claudius. Claudius in his letter
of warning to the Jews in Egypt (preserved in a papyrus in the British
Museum, P. Lond. 1912) described them as"the fomenters of a universal
plague.".

    [[link](https://www.unz.com/article/how-fake-is-roman-antiquity/)]
    for a few authors who make the claim that the "first Rome" was based
    out of Anatolia. I subscribe to this theory as well. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. Also, the word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called 'Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn' ('Kingdom of the Romans'), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the 'new History' that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    --Sir Isaac Newton, in his book 'The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended' (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand. Anatoly Fomenko also makes several other controversial
    claims in his work, specifically that Charlemagne was not a real
    person, but one of the phantom individuals Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same person.
    The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic Plague (it's
    a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed "Dark Ages") is
    exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. Also, the 'first
    Rome' was based out of Anatolia, in an area that is modern Istanbul.
    The last point I independently confirmed. Julius Caesar = Asander of
    Bosphorus, and all early Christianity traces back to to the
    Bosphorus.

[^2]: Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to
    the Indo-Aryan word for 'king' and Julius (Iulius) is similar to
    both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for 'sun'). Julius Caesar
    was deified in two religions: in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is
    related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which
    made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (There was no letter J in
    Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both
    derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky
    Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus', and
    (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of 'Dyeus Pter' ->
    Diespiter -> Iupiter), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus
    Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented,
    Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was
    put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high
    priest) in his religion. \

[^5]: His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod, Mithridates Chrestus descendant?) after Rome's defeat of Parthia around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate the Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant carried the title Monobazus aka Manu-Sabazios). The Mithras cult has many similarities to Christianity; Mithras was born of a virgin, Mithras' birth was celebrated on December 25, Mithras was considered a savior and redeemer, etc., although all these traits are 'de jure' of saviors in ancient religions, probably because they all came from the 'Alexandrian School' in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism, Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and many other religions came from the Alexandrian School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint for these religions./

[^6]: Jesus ben Fabus who was Isa Amen (Jesus Amen) of Rev. iii. 14 who
    was also Amyntas (Amen(tas)) of Galatia who was also Amyntas Nikator
    (the name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben
    Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Persian 'Bagus' means
    god. 'Boga' in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona
    'Bog-' means god in Celtic. In Latin Nikator translates tro
    Invictus). His palace at Iśauria reveals his name as Iśa. (See:

[^7]: The name Herod likely derives from the amalgamation of Horus and
    Hercules (Herakles in Greek). Mark Antony claimed descent from Hercules and declared
    himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became king of judaea around the time of Mark Antony's "suicide". This is typical for these elites, they would kill off one character and then assume another one in a different location as if they were actors in a play\
    --The Shekel of Tyre that King
    Herod minted depicts Mark Antony and an image of Hercules:
    https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels
    [[link](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels)]. Herod also built a number of temples and shrines dedicated to Hercules, including one in Beirut and another in Tyre. He also depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. King Herod's son, Herod Antipas, has the same name as Mark Antony's son, Antyllus, King Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius, Mark Antony's son with Fulvia. The wife of Iullus Antonius is called Marcella daughter of Octavian/Augustus’ sister Octavia. Fulvia and Antony also are said to have had two daughters, Antonia I and Antonia II. Caligula and Claudius were descendants of Antonia I. Probably Antonia I and/or II was the sister of Herod the Great called Salome. Probably there is also a connection between "Costabar" husband of Salome and the Roman "Ahenobarbus" who married Antonia I.
    --Mark Antony (King Herod) = Tiberius Claudius Nero. The way to make this connection is through the equivalence of Doris the first wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of Octavius/Caesar Augustus. Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but not happily. In 39 BC she gave birth to a daughter, Julia, but was divorced by Augustus. In the same year he became engaged to Livia Drusilla, who was at the time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband. That husband was Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor of 62 BC. Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla's son was emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus.

[^8]: Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias was also King
    Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua
    Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy
    aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. (See: Jesus, King of Edessa (2012) by Ralph
    Ellis
    [[link](https://x.com/ralfellis/status/1809520320077803525)]).
    King Izates of Monobazus was married to the sister of Dynamis's
    mother. --Cleopatros in Hebrew is QLPTRS and was shortened on
    inscriptions to QTRS or Katros, later mistakenly recorded as
    Cantheras. So the Jews for derogatory reasons called it as Panthera.

[^53]: Simon was also "Simon the Essene" the founder of the Essene sect
    and "Simon Peter" in the bible? The term "Peter" is derived from the
    Latin "Pater" meaning "father," denoting the Essene High Priest. The
    Essenes called themselves "the Sons of Zadok" and Simon was the heir
    of the Zadokite (High Priest) dynasty. One of Simon's sons used the
    title Zadok as his name (Josephus: Antiquities 18:1:1). Sadduc
    (Sadducean) and Zadok are the same word rendered respectively the
    Greek way and the Hebrew way in our alphabet. The Sons of Zadok are
    a family of priests (kohanim) that descended from Zadok and are the
    upper echelons of Judean society. Also, Ha-Simeon = Hasmoneans. The
    Kohanim were entrusted with carrying the Torah and other jewish
    writings and their status transferred from father to son. --The name
    "Simon" probably denoted that he was of the tribe of Simon/Simeon
    --In Hebrew, the house of Onias is "Beit Honniyah". --The name
    "Boethus" is a misrecorded name from oral tradition. It was Bayztus
    originally, or bar YZT or bar Izates. YZT being the original Aramaic
    and Izates a Greek sounding variant. It meant "Yakov zu Tolomy" or
    Jacob aka Ptolemy. --https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_Flora
    (the Letter to Flora and the Tripartite Tractate write about a
    Gnostic teacher called "Ptolemy" who I identify as Ptolemy Menneus
    aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus).
    --https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok#Other_Zadoks --Does the bust
    depicting a late Ptolemaic leader sometimes attributed to Ptolemy IX
    actually depict Ptolemy Menneus aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus?
    The bust depicts a jewish physiognomy and a beard shaved in a jewish
    style.

    --Alexander's (grandson of King Herod) father Alexander (son of King
    Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II was supposed to have been
    killed by his father Herod, but this is obviously untrue. Josephus
    even has a story about a "spurious Alexander" that showed up in Rome
    claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [link].
    Alexander (son of King Herod) was executed by Caligula (probably for
    spreading the psyop religion) --Alexander (son of King Herod) aka
    Juba II was also "Monobazus" who was the king of the Parthian client
    state of Adiabene in the 20s and 30s of the 1st century AD. This is
    why the Muslims refer to jesus as "Isa" or "Iza" and in the Yazadi
    (Izadi) religion the prophet is Sultan Ezid. --"for Alexander [son
    of King Herod] had two sons by Glaphyra". Josephus, Antiquities of
    the Jews, Book XVII. Containing The Interval Of Fourteen
    Years---From The Death Of Alexander And Aristobulus To The

    --Matrilineally, Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister
    wife "Philo" descend from Mark Antony and Cleopatra. The Talmud says
    that Mark Antony was born to a jewish mother. His first wife Fulva
    was jewish, and Cleopatra was a Ptolemaic ruler and her family had a
    long history of intermarriage with Jews, so this family was almost
    fully jewish. The bust attributed to Mark Antony that is housed in
    the Vatican Museum was made over a century after he died during the
    Flavian dynasty. This: https://imgur.com/7RnVvRv is the only bust
    that is believed to have been made during his lifetime. --Alexander
    (grandson of King Herod) was the controller of the Egyptian gold
    mines, shipping ports and warehouses, at least 1/3 of the imperial
    Roman revenue went through him. He was also the administrator for
    the extensive land estates in Egypt owned by his aunt Antonia Minor
    (Emperor Claudius's wife, Emperor Augustus niece, and she was Mark
    Anthony's youngest daughter) (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 19.276).

[^79]: Scipio Africanus was the first high priest in the Flammen Dialis
    cult which made him the claimed son of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. His
    mother was divinely impregnanted by Jupiter. He was also the Salian
    Priest of Mars, 'second Romulus' (founder of Rome), and Consul of
    the Republic and Censor. He was the 'messiah' of Rome. Julius Caesar
    modeled himself off of Alexander the Great and Scipio.

[^92]: The reason why the Roman aristocracy used so many aliases and
    acted as different characters as if they were actors in a play was
    to hide the fact that the population was ruled by an oligarchy
    because if they knew they would revolt. Also, multiple names hides
    the fact that these royal families were heavily into incest which
    would have repulsed the population.
