**Prolegomenon: Methodology and Historiographical Approach**  

This book traces Christianity back to its foundations — from the mythemes of Scythian snake-worshiping cults, to the Alexandrian School in Egypt and the Sarapis cult, to the Roman (Bosphoran) imperial cult — and then finishes with the subversion of the Bosphoran cult by the Flavian Dynasty (Vespasian, Titus).

In contrast to conventional narratives, this work directly challenges mainstream historiography. My methodologies are:
numismatic and onomastic evidence, and historical correlation and timeline analysis. The sources that inspired my work are listed in the 'Bibliography' section at the
end of the book.

**Introduction**
 
Christianity is a Flavian Dynasty hijacking of one of the religions that were invented at the Alexandrian School in Egypt. The Alexandrian School was a religion-making factory that was set up by Ptolemy Soter. The Serapis cult, Judaism, Gnosticism, Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and many other religions originated from there. 

Religion was the technology that the Ptolemaic dynasty used to control the vast and disparate populations they ruled and they created religions in every single conquered land. They would take local customs and create a syncretic man-god representing the Ptolemaic pharaoh (the principle of 'Interpretatio Graeca'). This system had one primary function: to psychologically pacify conquered populations and prevent unified rebellion. They would package these religions as sects of local religions because getting people to abandon their religions for a new one is an impossible task. However, there are thousands of sects of major religions today, many with different prophets (e.g., Christianity as Judaism's "fulfillment"). 

Beyond the surface-level imperial fiction, all these Alexandrian School religions contained the same psychological weapon at their core: centralized texts and priesthoods which makes a population easier to control through proxy, moral codes like submission, self-sacrifice, obedience, loyalty, divine judgment, the concept of hell, and monotheism which divides the population through binary thinking, ie., the opposition between good and evil, us vs them, left vs right, etc., which destroys tribalism/collectivism by splitting the population into two opposing groups. These religions were also likely designed to segment the populations by class, culture, and region to prevent unified resistance. For example, Mithraism was for military elites (requiring blood oaths, with a Mithraic initiate caste system and hierarchical structure). Serapism was for civilians (promising afterlife salvation). Christianity was for slaves ("turn the other cheek").(these caste-based religions could have also served as eugenic breeding systems/domestication systems selecting for warrior or priestly/intellectual traits among the upper castes and docility among the slave castes. This system became inverted once Christianity rose to become the main religion in the empire)

"Jesus Christ" was originally a rank, not a name. It was the title for the Satrap-Soter (Governor-Savior) of the Levant-Judea sector, a high-level administrative and priestly position within the Ptolemaic/Bosphoran imperial structure, often filled by a bloodline prince, much like 'Pharaoh' or 'Caesar'. 

"Ie-Zeus" = Ie- means "divine" in Proto-Indo-European languages, and Ie- (or Ia-) means "Lord" in Anatolian Hieroglyphic Luwian and is used for deified kings. Iza‑ / Izad‑ = "lord" in Iranian, and Isa means lord in Sanskrit. Ie-Zeus means "Divine Zeus", or "Lord Zeus". But Zeus = Dyēus = Jupiter = Jove (Iove). Jupiter comes from Dyēus Pter ("Sky Father") which is the original name of the chief god for the Proto-Indo-Europeans on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. His name means "Shining Sky Father". The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" (Diespiter -> Iupiter). (J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e., Yahweh/YHWH. YHWH is translated in the Bible as Lord. Therefore, "Jesus" (Yahweh-Zeus) = "The Jovian One" or "The Jupiterian Lord". "Ioudaioi" means "People of Jove".

Christios/Kristos was the job title for the Governor (Satrap) of Judea who was a member of the Bosporan royal house, equivalent to Scythian Xšaθra, Persian "Kšatrapati", Hyksos "Khasut" in Egypt, Kshatriya in Sanskrit which also = Vedic "Krishna", etc.

The name Julius Caesar "Julius" comes from Iovilius (of Jove) and in the Flamen Dialis cult Julius Caesar was the high priest of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

Judaism was their cult for the Levant-Judea sector of their empire. They just took the existing local deity, El or El Elyon (The Most High God), and syncretized them with the attributes and name of Iove/Jupiter. Ancient Judaism was simply the Roman imperial cult synchronized with Cannonite beliefs. 

"Jesus Christ" = "The Jupiterian King, the Anointed Governor", or Yahweh-Zeus, the Anointed Governor"

The people who assumed this role were the descendants of Mark Antony aka King Herod (aka Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus aka Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt):

-   Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas, King of Galatia, who was Mark Antony aka King Herod's son under his Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus alias. He was also Jesus ben Fabus. (See:
    Jesus Christ Was Amyntas of Galatia (2010) by Ranajit Pal
    [^1]). The gens Fabia (Fabus) was one of the most ancient patrician families in ancient Rome.
-   Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Alexander Helios aka Juba II. Was he Jesus ben Panthera? "Panthera" is a Hellenized corruption of "Ptolemaios" (Ptolem -> Ptol -> Panther). "Jesus, son of Ptolemy". The Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus the "Sons of Ptolemy".
-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Ptolemy of Mauretania aka Monobazus I. Who was Jesus ben Sapphias?
-   Izates II, King of Adiabene who was the son of Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister-wife Cleopatra (Thea
Philopator) of Mauretania. He was Mark Antony aka King Herod's great-grandson. He was was Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel (See: Cleopatra to Christ (2010) by Ralph Ellis. Iza‑ / Izad‑ = "lord" Iranian, and Zates = Dyeus/Zeus. The same name as Jesus.
[^2])
-   Tiberius Julius Sauromates II

It is likely that all the descendants of Mark Antony aka king Herod took on this role, or roles that may be similar. For example, see: Jesus Among the Julio-Claudians (2021) by Charles N. Pope
[^3] who claims that Aristobulus V of Chalcis, grandson of king Herod aka Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus was Jesus, or The Herodian Messiah Case For Jesus As Grandson Of Herod (2010) by Joseph Raymond.
[^4]

Jesus Christ then became a composite literary character based on the defeated Satrap-King Izates II of Adiabene ("Kingdom of Heaven") and other Jesus-avatars after the First Jewish-Roman War (66–73 CE). The Flavian Dynasty weaponized his imperial cult and created a virus within the host: a "religion" that systematically inverted the original cult by transforming the governing elite's title into the name of a sacrificial victim. Tiberius Julius Alexander aka "Josephus", who was the Flavian court historian, was the prefect of Egypt at this time and had control of the Library of Alexandria and the Alexandrian School, and with the help of Alexandrian School scribes, is likely who was responsible for creating history's most devastating psy-op—a forged testament that was later used to shatter the very empire that authored it. He was also likely the one who burned down the Library of Alexandria soon after to cover up the tracks of his conspiracy. (Ironically, Tiberius Julius Alexander aka "Josephus" was the brother of Izates II who was Marcus Julius Alexander).

What the reader needs to know before entering this book:

-   Conventional history is a synthetic construct, a palimpsest written over multiple times by victors. The primary forgers were the Flavian emperors, the Vatican, and the Jesuits. What they overwrote is that the Egyptian-Persian-Indian-Greek-Roman elite were a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Elite (Kurgan Culture) who were the horse-riding, chariot-inventing pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe who, beginning around 4500 BC, began a systematic conquest of Europe, Anatolia, and the Indus Valley, and who ruled through proxy dynasties. The domestication of the horse, invention of the chariot, and advanced ship building technology allowed them to travel vast distances and Egypt, Persia, India, Greece, Rome,
etc., were all at one point under the suzerainty of Aryan Iranian-Scythian elites and their base of operation was on the Cimmerian Bosphorus (Crimea–Kerch) river. Mainstream history presents a linear progression: Egypt -> Greece -> Persia -> Rome. This is a complete fabrication. The "ancient" civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Persia, and Rome were largely concurrent satrapies of the Scythian core. The Persian system of Satraps (Old Persian xšaçapāvan, "protector of the dominion") is the administrative blueprint of this hegemony. The title derives from Xšaya (to rule), which links to Roman Caesar and Sanskrit Kshatriya. Every Satrap was a regional "dragon-king" enforcing the center's will.
-   During the "Jewish-Roman" Wars the Flavians were not putting down a provincial revolt. The Flavians launched a blitzkrieg against the core Eastern administration and this destroyed the Scythian steppe hegemony. "Jewish" at the the time did not mean "tribe of Judah" it meant "tribe of Jove/Jupiter" and they were Celtic Iudii Jupiter worshippers, unrelated to modern "jews". Then the Flavian dynasty and their court historians (Josephus, Pliny, Tacitus) took their primary political enemy, King Izates II, and rewrote his cult as pacifist allegory to subvert the people of his kingdom using the same Alexandian School formula they used in all their imperial cults. They also rewrote history to erase their Bosphoran origins. The Flavians (Pālava or Palavi/Pahlavi, which was the term for the Parthian/Iranian aristocracy) were a Sauromatian clan who broke away from the old R1a-Z93 haplotype royal Bosphoran line (the Sauromatians proper) and introduced a heavy J2/J1 (Jewish haplogroup) admixture from the Adiabene–Osrhoene region. The haplotype R1a (the famed "Arya" gene) was the dominant haplogroup of the Roman elite before the Flavian empire. After the Flavian reign the haplotype J2/J1 became the dominant haplogroup among the Roman elite. This is why they erased the Scythian origins of ancient civilizations and painted the Scythians (R1a) as monstrous foreigners (see: Chapter 8. Who Forged History?). 
-   Western Rome in Italy is a phantom empire that did not conquer the kingdoms of the East. Western Rome is a Flavian fabrication. The Bosphoran royal house created Western Rome as a military garrison. The original Rome (in Sarmatian, "Ruma" (Rome) = "Place of the Dragon" (Rhu-Ma, from Aži Dahāka, the Iranian dragon)) was located on the Bosphorus river which approximates to modern-day Crimea in southern Ukraine. There was a split between East and West during the Flavian period and the Flavians erased their Bosphoran origins.
-   Asander, king of Bosphorus aka Julius Caesar was also Cleopatra's uncle Ptolemy of Cyprus (brother of Ptolemy XII Auletes and husband of "Mithridates") aka Mithridates Chrestus, King of Pontus VI (brother of Mithridates VI, king of Pontus), but he took on numerous other regional aliases. Cleopatra was also Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus. Mark
Antony the Neos-Dionysos was Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII Auletes (Auletes name adapts well to the
Parthian Orodes (II?)) the Neos Dionysos aka  Mithridates VI Eupator aka Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus, prince of Pontus (Polemos ->
Ptolemy) aka King Herod (Egyptian: Heru (Horus) + Ud
(divine) -> Herud -> "Herod") aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates
IV of Parthia (Per-aa or Per-Nesu is a corruption of Pharaoh). Cleopatra's full name, Cleopatra VII
Philopator, derives from the Ancient Greek 'Φιλοπάτωρ' meaning "the one
who loves her father", or simply "father-loving". She was also married
to two of her brothers and her uncle as listed previously. This is how
incestuous this family was.

**1 The Imperial Avatar System: Numismatic Proof and Aliases**

The foundation of this book rests on a single, verifiable fact: the ruling elite of the ancient world operated a system of regional aliases, or avatars, to govern their global empire. The evidence for this is not hidden in obscure texts, but is stamped on the coins they issued—the primary-source bulletins of their reign. This chapter presents the visual and administrative proof of this system.

1.1 The Numismatic Key: Coins of a Global Empire

Coins are the unlying testimony. They cannot be forged by later historians. The following coins prove that the figures known to us as separate historical entities were, in fact, the same individuals or offices operating across different administrative regions.

The Foundational Avatar: Julius Caesar is Asander, king of Bosporus

![Fig.1.1](/images/caesarstar.jpg){:width="400px"}\
![Fig.1.2](/images/asandernike.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.1 & 1.2. (L) Julius Caesar. (R) Asander, king of Bosphorus depicting a Nike which was the Greek goddess of victory and a close companion of Zeus. Other depictions of Asander show the star and cresent that is visible in the Julius Caesar coin above [^5]. Another coin of Asander depicts a Phrygian cap which is closely associated with the Roman god Mithras: [^6]. This (https://bosporan-kingdom.com/224-3094/) coin of Asander displays a prow (front of a ship) that is also seen in Julius Caesar coins. The star and crescent in above coins was the symbol of the city of Byzantium/Constantinople long before the Ottomans used it. The legend was that Byzas, the founder, chose the site based on a vision of a crescent moon and a star. This symbol represented the fusion of the lunar goddess (Hecate/Artemis, who was associated with snakes) and the solar god (Apollo). By using this symbol, Asander and Caesar were not just using a random symbol; they were explicitly claiming lordship over the Bosphorus.

The Avatar Succession: Roman Emperors are Bosporan Kings

The following side-by-side comparisons prove that the Julio-Claudian and Flavian emperors were the ruling dynasty of the Bosporan Kingdom, their faces stamped on coinage in both the "Roman" West and the "Bosporan" East.

![Fig.1.3](/images/RhoemetalcesOctavian.jpg){:width="400px"}\
Fig. 1.3. L. Rhoemetalces I, king of Bosphorus. R. Emperor Augustus (Octavian). Talces = the Thracian word for "king" or "ruler". Rhoemetalces = "king of Rhome", or "king of Rome" in ancient Thracian.

![Fig.1.4](/images/PtolemyXIIIArchelaus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.4. L. Coin depicting Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator the brother-husband of Cleopatra. Compare it to the Rhoemetalces I, king of Bosphorus aka Emperor Augustus (Octavian) coin above. R. Coin depicting Archelaus, king of Caesarea, Cappadocia (modern-day Kayseri, Turkey). Archelaus of Cappadocia was married to  Pythodorida of Pontus (Cleopatra/Dynamis). Polemon Pythodoros (Julius Caesar/Asander) was also married to Pythodorida of Pontus.

![Fig.1.5](/images/AspurgusTiberius.jpg){:width="400px"}\
Fig. 1.5. L. Tiberius Julius Aspurgus I, king of Bosphorus. R. Emperor Tiberius Caesar Augustus.

![Fig.1.6](/images/KadphisesTiberius.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.6. Tiberius Julius Aspurgus I, king of Bosphorus aka Emperor Tiberius Caesar Augustus was also Kujula Kadphises, prince of the Kushan Empire (a vast territory stretching from Central Asia into northern India). Kujula Kadphises unifies the Yuezhi tribes and establishes the Kushan Empire right after the "death" of Julius Caesar/Asander. This is not a successor state; it is the same ruler shifting his primary administrative center to Central Asia to manage the Silk Road. The "Yuezhi" are the "Iudii"/"Jove" tribe—the same Scythian-Celtic priestly class. This regional avatar also connects to the legendary Chinese emperor Yu the Great (original name "Aži" or "Yazhi" (亞茲))? Julius, from Ioulius, related to Iove (Jove).

![Fig.1.7](/images/MithridatesIIICaligula.jpg){:width="400px"}\
Fig. 1.7. L. Mithridates III, king of Bosphorus. R. Emperor Caligula.

![Fig.1.8](/images/CotysIClaudius.jpg){:width="400px"}\
Fig. 1.8. L. Cotys I, king of Bosphorus. R. Emperor Claudius.

![Fig.1.9](/images/RhescuporisIVespasian.jpg){:width="400px"}\
Fig. 1.9. L. Rhescuporis I, king of Bosphorus. R. Emperor Vespasian.

![Fig.1.10](/images/PolemonIITitus.jpg){:width="400px"}\
Fig. 1.10. L. Polemon II, king of Bosphorus. R. Emperor Titus.

1.2 Ancient Alias Names List

Note on Aliases: I believe that the Bosphoran/Ptolemaic elites in antiquity employed an incredible number of regional aliases, locations, fictional stories, faked adoptions, and fabricated deaths for themselves and their family members as a way to control the
population. They role-played as deities, religious figures, and various characters as if they were actors in a play. This was done partially for obscuration, but also because people wouldn't accept foreign kings or kings with foreign names, and also, for theological requirements: a god-king had to manifest in different regions according to local religious expectations. However, as their names were mostly job titles an etymology across languages (Latin, Greek, "Old Persian," Sanskrit, Aramaic) reveals a unified administrative lexicon, and you can also expound their aliases through spouses. For example, the governor of Roman Egypt from 33 CE to 38, Aulus Avillius Flaccus, was also Polemon II of Pontus, who was
the prince of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, which was
the regional alias of Emperor Titus. The character of Aulus Avillius
Flaccus dies at the same time Polemon II of Pontus takes power, and then
Polemon II of Pontus dies around the same time Titus becomes emperor.
The way to connect them is through the fact that they were all married
to the same woman, Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod (Bernice was also married to a man named "Marcus Antonius Polemo II").

I. The Ptolemaic, Julio-Claudian & Bosphoran Bloodline

Alexander the Great's successors ("Diadochi") were Seleucus I Nicator who controlled a large chunk of the eastern territories, including Mesopotamia and Persia, Diodotus I Soter who controlled Bactria (possibly also India under the alias Ashoka the Great), and Ptolemy I Soter who controlled Egypt. Mainstream history presents the Ptolemies, Seleucids, Attalids, and Romans as separate, often warring entities. This is a Flavian-Vatican fabrication. In reality, they were four branches of a single Scythian-Sarmatian dynasty, a "Tetrarchy", administering different sectors of the empire from the Bosphoran center.

- Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus = Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt
  Aliases: Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius = Mar (Phoenician "lord") + Anton (from Antaeus, giant son of Gaia)), King Herod (Heru (Horus) + Ud (divine) = Herud -> Herod, "The Divine Horus", or Herodes (-dēs common Greek patronymic suffix meaning "son of"), "Son of Horus". The "Slaughter of the Innocents" is a mythological trope attached to the birth of every Horus-figure who must overcome a threat (against Set). It is not history; it is theological propaganda asserting Herod's/Mark Antony's legitimacy as the living god-king against the resurrected one. This is also attached to the Indian god Krishna (against Kamsa)), Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus, prince of Pontus  (Polemos -> Ptolemy). Tiberius Claudius Nero, Phraates IV of Parthia (Per-aa or Per-Nesu is a corruption of Pharaoh). Ariarathes IX (Arya-Ratha". Sanskrit:"Noble Charioteer") Eusebes Philopator, King of Cappadocia. Was he also Ptolemy X Alexander I aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus? Hyspaosines of Characene? Mithridates VI Eupator and Mark Antony are both recorded as marrying a sister-wife named Cleopatra (Antony to Cleopatra VII; Mithridates VI to Laodice, who used "Cleopatra" as a throne name and Mithridates VI of Pontus was also recorded to have married Cleopatra of Athamania and their daughter was Cleopatra of Pontus (https://web.archive.org/web/20101126090909/http://mauriceboddy.org.uk/Pontus.htm)). King Herod was married to Cleopatra of Jerusalem, and Mithridates VI Eupator and Ptolemy XII Auletes both had daughters named Cleopatra (Cleopatra VII/Cleopatra the Elder, princess of Pontus). The Shekel of Tyre minted by Herod depicts Mark Antony and Hercules and Herod built temples to Hercules in Beirut and Tyre, and depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. Herod's son Herod Antipas shares the name of Mark Antony's son Antyllus; Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius (Mark Antony's son with Fulvia), Herods son Alexander (son of King Herod) has the same name as Mark Antony's son Alexander Helios.
  - Spouse: Wife/sister: Laodice (in Pontus) = Cleopatra V Tryphaena (in Egypt)
  - Children:
    - Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator aka Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus, Cleopatra of Pontus, Pythodorida, queen of Pontus, Musa Thea Urania of Parthia (Parthian queen mother, same "Heavenly Goddess" title). Also, Amanirenas ("Amon is Lord"), Kandake of Kush? Dynamis was called "Dynamus Pilatea"(https://en.rodovid.org/wk/Person:401227) the same title that was carried by "Pontius Pilate". Dynamis is recorded as the grandaughter of Mithridates VI, but historians are probably confusing her with Cleopatra the Elder, princess of Pontus who was married to Tigranes II, king of Armenia. Cleopatra VII, Dynamis, and Pythodorida all had sons named Ptolemy Philadelphus who succeeded them.
    - Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator aka Gaius Octavius (Emperor Augustus). Aliases: Polemon I of Pontus (Dynamis was titled "Pilatea" and he was the king of Pontius. Pontius Pilate would have been his title that his descendants would have inherited it). Gaius Julius Sohaemus of Emesa. Rhoemetalces I (a classic Thracian royal name, linking to the "Rome" = "Ruma" etymology. Rhoemetalces = "king of Rhome", or "king of Rome" in ancient Thracian), king of Bosphorus. Rhoemetalces Philocaesar of Pontus was the son of Marcus Antonius Polemon Pythodoros was married to Pythodoris I (Cleopatra). Polemon I of Pontus was married to Dynamis (Cleopatra). Cleopatra was married to her brother Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator who was born at the same time as Augustus. He was her brother husband. Asander was also married to Pythodoris I and Dynamis proving these were Cleopatra's aliases. Likely also Azes I, king of India.

- Julius Caesar = Asander, King of Bosporus aka Ptolemy of Cyprus (brother of Ptolemy XII Auletes and husband of "Mithridates") aka Mithridates Chrestus (he married the daughter of Mithridates VI, Laodice, who took the throne name "Cleopatra". Mithridates VI Eupator was also married to Laodice), King of Pontus VI (brother of Mithridates VI, king of Pontus).
  Titles: Philocaesar Philoromaios, Soter, Great King of Kings, "As" in his name refers to Asar(Osiris)/Aesar/Aeser/Aisar/Ais/Is). Other suspected aliases: Akrosandros II, King of Scythia, Brogitarix, Idumean Antipater, Gaius Asinius Pollio (literary pen-name), Parthian Artavasdes (Greek Alex = Persian Arta) who was the brother of Tigranes II who was married to Cleopatra the Elder, princess of Pontus (Tigranes II/the Great was called Azhdahak proving Aži Dahāka was a royal Scythian title), Artavasdes II, king of Armenia who was the son of Tigranes II and Cleopatra the Elder, princess of Pontusand the Hasmonean Alexander II (son of king Aristobulus II son of Jannaeus Alexander also the nephew and son-in-law of king/high-priest Hyrcanus II. Also, Julius = Janneus? Or Janneus (Yannai) is related to the Roman name Gaius?). juba I, King of Mauretania, Burebista, King of the Dacians, Atrebates, king of Britannia. Also Prince Jin Midi in China? Jin (金) means "Gold," a royal Scythian attribute. Mi (日) is "Sun." Di (磾) is a rare character meaning "black," but also a homophone for "Emperor" (帝). His story: A noble "barbarian" prince from the West (Xiongnu confederation, which included Saka/Scythians) is captured and rises to become the most powerful man in China, serving as regent to a child emperor. This is the exact same narrative archetype as a foreigner (Caesar) rising to power in Rome. Caesar's heir is Augustus. Asander's named successor is Aspurgus. Julius Caesar, Asander, Mithradates Chrestus and all had successors named Tiberius Julius (Tiberius Julius Augustus/Tiberius Julius Aspurgus/Tiberius Julius Mithridates).
  - Spouse/Consort: Cleopatra VII (Isis who in mythology was the wife of Osiris and the mother of Horus): Dynamis Ourania (Aphrodite Urania). Aliases: Pythodorida Philometor (Pytho- from python, and -doria from the Dorian tribe who were Scythian Greeks). Also, Amanirenas ("Amon is Lord"), Kandake of Kush?
  - Children:
    - Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus. Alias: Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios, king of Bosphorus (Aspurgos calls himself the son of "the great king of Asandrokhos" in an inscription. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390912485_Aspurgos_-_the_king_of_Bosporan_state_98_BC_-_AD_38). Also likely Kujula Kadphises, prince of Bactria. Also, was he the legendary Chinese emperor Yu the Great (original name "Aži" or "Yazhi" (亞茲))? Julius, from Ioulius, related to Iove (Jove). Iove is linguistically linked to the Scythian tribal name Yuehzi (Yuezhi). He is "The Jove/Yuezhi King"? Also, Artaxias II king of Armenia? (Artaxes is Arta-Uksha which is the same as Kadphises or Gud-Vrsa)
      - Spouse: Vipsania Agrippina. The name Vipsania is obscure, but Agrippina means "wild horse" (from agri- "wild" and -pina "mare"), and Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios's wife, known only through numismatic evidence, was Gepae-pyris (Gepa- from hippos, "horse" in Greek, cf. Epona, Celtic horse goddess and -epyris (possibly "lady" or "queen"). Both names encode "Horse-Queen." This is a title for a Sarmatian noblewoman of the steppe horse-culture.
      - Children:
        - Tiberius Julius Mithridates III (Italian Avatar: Emperor Caligula)
        - Tiberius Julius Cotys I. Italian Avatar: Emperor Claudius = Rhoemetalces II of Bosporus (Reigns are nearly perfectly co-terminus. Polemon Pythodoros (Julius Caesar/Asander) and Pythodorida of Pontus (Cleopatra/Dynamis) had a daughter Antonia Tryphaena. Her son was Rhoemetalces II whose reign coincided with emperor Claudius)
        - Tiberius Julius Aspurgus had a son named Tiberius Julius (Abdes Panthera) who was a brother of "Mithridates" (https://en.rodovid.org/wk/Person:401221). I am unsure if this is Tiberius Julius Cotys I or another son. The name "Panthera" is famously connected to the father of Jesus (Yeshua ben Panthera). This connection proves that the Mithridatic dynasty and Bosphoran royal house were the same, and they carried the Tiberius Julius Roman royal title. Tiberius Julius Abdes Panthera's son was named Judas Pantera (https://en.rodovid.org/wk/Person:497363)

- Child of Antony/Herod & Dynamis/Cleopatra:
  - Alexander (son of King Herod). Aliases: Alexander Helios, Juba II of Mauretania. Juba II is titled "Ptolemy" upon accession in Mauretania. Also, Apollonius of Tyana?
    - Spouse: Cleopatra Selene II (twin sister)
    - Children:
      - Alexander (grandson of King Herod). Aliases: (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka  Panthera, the name for jesus's father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or Cleopatros. Also, Panthera = Ptolemy in Hebrew), Tiberius Julius Alexander Major, Alexander the Alabarch. Also, Gondophares, Indo-Parthian King?
        - Spouse: Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania. Aliases: Cleopatra IX, Helene, Drusilla of Mauretania, Julia Ourania of Parthia, Philo of Alexandria. She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary "Pallas", and "Antonia Caenis" who was Vespasian's first cousin and mistress (the full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas, with the Antonius part being an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony and that Pallas wasn’t a random slave. Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo. Pallas also connects to King Herod as that was the name of one of his wives). In "The Additions to the Book of Esther" it states that the work had been translated by "Lysimachus son of Ptolemy" in Jerusalem. Philo's brother was named Alexander Lysimachus.
        - Children:
          - Tiberius Julius Alexander: Emperor Nerva, Arrius Piso, Josephus (Josephus lists his father as Matthias, a priest. "Matthias" is a Hellenized form of Mithradates)
          - Marcus Julius Alexander: Izates Monobazus ("Jesus Emmanuel"), Yeshua Cleopatros. Also Gaius Calpurnius Piso? Izates daughter was named 
"Cleopatra of Adiabene" (https://gw.geneanet.org/arnac?lang=en&n=d+adiabene&p=kleopatra) who married Lucius Catilius Severus. Their great-grandson was emperor Marcus Aurelius. His other daughter was Julia Urania of Partha married Vologases I King of Parthia. "Cleopatra" (Cleopatra Drusilla of Adiabene) was also recorded as the wife of Gaius Julius Alexander (actualy Marcus Julius Alexander), Herodian Prince of Judaea and Izates II, King of Adiabene (https://www.geni.com/people/Cleopatra/6000000003645870120)

IV. Flavian Emperors

- Vespasian
  Aliases: Rhescuporis I, king of Bosphorus. Herod Agrippa I (See: The Royal Ancestry of Emperor Vespasian. Henry Davis, [^7]). Flavius Scaevinus. Also, Vologases I of Parthia?
- Titus. Aliases: Polemon II, Aulus Avillius Flaccus.

V. Speculative

- Ateas the Scythian = Amyntas III of Macedon (d. 370 BC) = Artaxerxes I of Persia (d. 424 BC) = Nepherites I of Egypt (d. 393 BC). aka Evagoras I of Salamis (Cyprus). 
    - Son: Philip II of Macedon. Philip was a title (Philippos (Lover of Horses) is a direct Greek translation of the Scythian royal title Pharnavaz (Horse-Lord)). \
    - Grandson 1: Alexander the Great: Alexander was his title. "Aži-ander" = Aži
    (Avestan "dragon") + Andros (Greek "man") = "Dragon-Man", the same as Akrosander/Akrosas. Alaksandu
    of Wilusa, a Hittie king of Wilusa (Troy) (Alaksandu = Alak-San-Du
    (Hurrian: "Ruler-Dragon-Son")), who predates Alexander by 800 years,
    proves that the name Alexander was a Scythian title for kings. In India he took the regional alias of Chandragupta Maurya
    ("Chandragupta" = "Sander-Gupta" (Scythian "Sander" = Alexander. "Aleks" = Greekization of "Alakh" which means "not seen" or "unseen" and in Sanskrit/Hindi "Gupta" = Hidden)). Greek sources (Megasthenes) refer to Chandragupta Maurya as "Sandrokottos" with the Sandro- deriving from Alexandros. Aži-Sandar also = "Dragon King" in Mittani and Old Persian. Recorded in
   the Persian 'Iskandarnameh', or 'Book of Alexander', and 'Shahnameh' and Islamic sources, is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince named Bubares who was the son of Artaxerxes
    II Memnon (Kai Bahman), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon'
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'.He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta. Alexander's mother Olympias (Ol or ophis + Pias = "serpent queen"), who was a Scythian princess of the
    Molossian tribe, claimed to have been impregnated by the god Zeus
    Ammon disguised as a serpent. Alexander also married the Scythian princess Roxana. Alexanders campaign was not a conquest, it was a Scythian restoration. The Achaemenid Persians (Achaemenes is likely Akh-Manesh or "Spirit of Manu", linking to the Vedic sage-king) were a rival Scythian clan (the "Ariya" - Aryans). Alexander was re-establishing the older, purer Scythian hegemony of the Medes and the pre-Zoroastrian Mitanni. In the Old Testament he was Solomon (Sol-Amūn or "Sun of Amun") which is a direct parallel to "Zeus-Ammon", a title he carried. He was also Qin Shi Huang in China. The "King of Kings" and "King of the World" titles Alexander and Cyrus used were literal. They were kings of a global empire.\
    - Grandson 2: "Dara" (Darius III) aka Seleucus I Nicator. He inherited the vital Eastern territories (Asia). His "father" is listed as Antiochus (of Macedon) and presumed to have been a commoner. The name Antiochus curiously has no definition in Greek, however when viewed as a hybrid Greek-Persian name the meaning is obvious. Antiochus should be parsed as Anti-Ochus, "Like/After Ochus", that is, continuing the line of Persian Great King Ochus (Artaxerxes III). Ochus, in addition to his ill-fated successor Artaxerxes IV, had many other children. And Artaxerxes IV, although not surviving long as Great King, had many children of his own. Anti-Ochus/Antiochus therefore emerges as a princely son or grandson of Artaxerxes III. (Darius III took on the name Ochus and also had a son by Queen Statiera named Ochus). The name Seleucus (Greek Seleukos), like that of his father Antiochus, has no certain meaning in Greek. (However, compare Greek leukos meaning “white”, and the kingly Roman name of Lucius.) As with the name Antiochus, we must expect some kind of hybrid definition that incorporated a Persian or Eastern element. There is certainly an echo of Seleukos in the later dynastic name Seljuk(os), associated with a people brought from the direction of China to dominate the West. He was Li Si in China who was the advisor to Qin Shi Huang (Alexander) founder of the Qin Dynasty.
    - Grandson 3: Ptolemy I Soter who received Egypt.
-  Moses = Manes/Mannu-Kuras = Manu (Scythian Sage-King) = Menes (Egypt’s legendary founder). Also appears in "Monobazus" → “Manu Bazus” → Sarmatian-Mythological Sage King. The Iranian Manu is a legendary civilizer, and in India he becomes the first Lawgiver (the Manu Smriti = Scythian governance code). The biblical Moses defeats Pharaoh (actually Mitanni elite), parts waters with a serpent-staff—obvious encoding of dragon-kingship (Aži Dahāka). Moses takes on different masks: M enes – the first official Pharaoh (not real, a compilation of conquerors). Menes – the semi-mythical Median king, founder of the priest-class. Mannu-kuras – Proto-Mede, whose name becomes Cyrus. The name Kur-Ash = "Sun Man". The Exodus is not Judaic memory: it's a political memory of Mitanni-Scythian expulsion from Egypt after the religious revolution of Thutmose III → Horemheb wiped them out with a new priest-kingship in Amarna. He shows up in a number of religions: In Zoroastrianism he is Manushchihr, in Hinuduisn he is Manu, in Judaism he is Moses, in Norse mythology he is Mannus, etc.
-  Paul the Apostle = a composite character or an avatar/cipher. Originally Gaius Asinius Pollio (Asander aka Julius Caesar's pen-name), then Saulus ben Antipater who was the
    son of Antipater/Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, grandson of King Herod
    (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Chapter 9, section 211), and Rabbi Akiva (whose students included: Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter (Shimon bar Yonah). The character
    Paul/Saul's life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story
    "Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor". Josephus in Antiquities of the
    Jews, Book XX (Ch 9.4) refers to Paul (Saulus) as related to Herod
    Agrippa.
-  Pythagoras: Abaris the Hyperborean. The high priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi was called Pythia [^8] who breathed serpent vapors (ethylene gas). Greek writers regarded the Hyperboreans as the mythical founders of Apollo's shrines at Delos and Delphi  [^9]. The name "Pythagoras" is derived from the Greek words "Pythios" (Πύθιος), meaning "of Pythia" or "belonging to the Pythia ("Pythoness"), and "Agoras" is a direct linguistic link to "Agaroi", the name of the Scythian snake-venom priesthood. Abaris was a Scythian and the Scythians worshiped snake deities. Pythia was probably Pythagoras' mother.

**2. Name and Title Meanings**

The Flavians didn't just remake their main enemy's cult, they rewrote history, including executing a systemic replacement of the titulary lexicon. For example, "Caesar" originally meant "Osiris-King" (Ka-Asar). The Flavians changed the etymology to caesaries ("hair"), claiming Julius Caesar was born via caesarean section or had lush hair. This severed the title from its Egyptian/Osirian roots and made it Roman.

-   AS/AŽI/AZ/SAR/XSA: Serpent-Dragon-King
     - Azhi = Až ("serpent") + Hi ("power, divine") in Avestan, meaning "mighty dragon". It extends Aži to signify divine authority across Indo-Iranian and Scythian cultures. Azhi = Asia (Azhi-A) = "land of the mighty dragon" (Aži is cognate with the Chinese Zhī (dragon)), a very similar name to Rome (Rhu-Ma) = "Place of the Dragon", Romania (Rhu-Ma + Na) = "dragon land", and Sarmatia (serpent) + ma (mother, land). Aži Aži (Avestan) links to As (Scythian/Thracian) = Lord, God. (Asa in Norse (Aesir), Asar in Egyptian (Osiris)). Sar (Scythian/Sanskrit) = King, Head. (Sarpa (Skt.) = serpent; Sarrum (Akk.) = king). In Iranian it becomes Ahura (as in Ahura Mazda - "Wise Lord"). The core imperial title was Aži-Sar or As-Sar — "Dragon-King". Asander (King of Bosporus): Asan-der = As (Lord/Serpent) + Andros (Man) = "Serpent-Lord-Man" or "Dragon-Man". Alexander: Aži-ander or Alak-san-der (Hurrian/Hittite) = Same formula: "Dragon-Man". Caesar: Aesar -> Kaesar -> Caesar or Kai-Sar. Kai (Greek: "and" but also a prefix of greatness) + Sar (King). Kaisar = "The Great King". The C is a Hellenized graft. The root is Sar. Kaiser, Czar, Shah: All derive from Sar. Osiris: Asar (Egyptian). Direct link to As (Lord). Osiris is the deified form of the Dragon King archetype. Jesus: Ie-Zeus (Divine Zeus). But Zeus=Dyēus (Sky Father). The Scythian form? Izas (as in Izates). Izates = Ie (divine) + Zates (cognate of Zeus). Ie-sus (Esus). The title connects to the Celtic Esus (Lord), another avatar of the same archetype. This creates a unified titulary field: Aži-Sar / Asander / Alexander / Caesar / Kaiser / Czar / Shah / Osiris / Izates / Jesus are linguistic variations of the same supreme office across different linguistic zones of the empire. All these were job titles, not personal names.
     - Sar = the Scythian word for "king". Sarpa in Sanskrit means "serpent". Sarmatian, Akkadian Sarrum (which becomes Persian Xšaya-/Xšayathiya), Hurrian Šarri, Sargon, Sarlagab, Serapis (Sar-Apis = "Serpent Bull"), Zarathustra (Sar + Ustra = "serpent-lord"), Saraswati (Hindi goddes of knowledge), Saracen (Roman designation for Middle Eastern peoples), Šaruma (Mitanni deity), Saragurs (Scythian tribe in China), Caesar, Asar (Osiris), Tsar (Slavic monarch), Sargon of Akkad, feminine Sarai (or "Sarah" meaning "princess" (Genesis 17:15)), etc. Sar means king, or serpent king, across the empires that the Scythians used to rule over.
-   Augustus: Not "venerable". It comes from Sauromatian Aspurgos ("Horse-King") → Aspur-g → Augur-stus → Augustus. Augustus translates to Sebastos in Greek. Augustus was also refered to as Sebastos in several inscriptions. This directly connects to Sabazios the Thracian/Phrygian deity and Monobazus which was a title that was held by several Adiabene kings.
-   Caesar: Core root is AS/AZ/AŠ. Its primary zoomorphic association is with the Serpent/Dragon (Aži, Azhi, Aži Dahāka). Azi-Sar - Dragon King. The Egyptian expression was Asar (Wsir/Osiris). "Asar" was another name for Osiris. "Ra" was the Egyptian deity of the Sun (Asar-Ra). Sar means king in Scythian. This title connects to "Asar-Hapi" (Osiris-Apis), another name for the
    Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis (Osiris + Apis = Osorapis). The Etruscan-Mediterranean expression was "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar") similar to the Egyptian Asar. The Greek language
    adds a "K" to foreign words, so Aesar -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin
    Caesar. Connected to the Scytho-Hurrian expression Kur-Sar (Sun King), Phoenician "Kosar" (sun god), Assyrian "Aššur" (god), Germanic Æsir (the Norse gods, like Odin), Sanskrit Kesari (lion), Persian Kesar (king), Scythian "As" (lord) and Scythian Sar (king), Kšar (from the Old Persian Xšaya = king), and also Cyrus the Great's title (Kuruš (Cyrus) = Khur (Sun) + -uš (lord)). "Caesar" = "Asander" = "Kesari" = "Xerxes" -> Xšathra-sar -> Khassar -> Khazar. Also, Caesar is at the root of the title "Khan" (Aesar -> Aesar -> A'sar -> Ha'sar -> Kha'sar -> Khan). Genghis" is "Janus". This proves that Genghis Khan was not a Mongol upstart. He was a later avatar of the Dragon King title, consciously restoring the global hegemony from its Central Asian core. The Mongol court called itself the "Great Yuan" (Great Ion/Janus)
-   Christ: Scythian Xšaθra (power, dominion) -> Kšatrapati" (Satrap, Governor) in Persian -> Hyksos "Khasut" in Egypt -> Kshatriya (Warrior-King) in Sanskrit (which also = Vedic "Krishna" (the dark god of Hinduism. Krishna is an avatar of Vishnu, and his name means "dark" or "black")) -> Christos. The title "Christ" did not mean a meek "anointed one" in the original context. It meant "the Satrap"—the imperial governor of the Dragon Kingdom. Jesus Christ was, in the original Bosporan cult, the title for the ruling Satrap of Judea, who was a member of the Bosporan royal house. The Flavian revision turned this title of worldly power into one of spiritual suffering. This title links India, Egypt, and Judea to a Scythian elite. Christ is identical to the title Soter. Several historical figures were
    Christs/Soters. In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus the Great "The
    Anointed One". Alexander the Great was also a Chréstos/Soter
    (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b). Up until the First
    Council of Nicaea the title "Christ", or "Christian", referred to the
    Serapis Cult ("those who worship Serapis are, in fact, Christians,
    and those who call themselves bishops of Christ are, in fact,
    devotees of Serapis.". Source: The Letter of Hadrian to Servianus).
-   Cotys: In Thracian, "Cotys" is related to the word "kotys", a title
    meaning "lord". In the Celtic languages the word "cottos" or
    "cottius" means "chieftain".
-   Flavius: Flavus = yellow/golden is a deliberate Latin mistranslation of the Scythian root Pālava or Palavi (Pahlavi), the term for the Parthian/Iranian aristocracy. The "Flavian" line was a Parthian/Sarmatian proxy dynasty installed by the Bosphoran center (Julius Caesar/Asander's line) to enforce the new Christianized Imperial Cult. They claimed a 'Golden Age' (Flavius) when they were truly the Pahlavi (Parthians) rewriting the Roman lie. 
-   Izates or Izas: Another name for Jesus. Ie- is a prefix denoting divinity (as in I-em-hotep in Egyptian and IE in Indo-European is a divine prefix (as in Ie-ove/Jove)). -sous is a variant of Zeus (Zas or Dyas is a cognate of Izas). Iesous = "Divine Zeus." This connects directly to Iulius (from Jupiter/Zeus). This becomes Jesus [^10], Aesus (Etruscan god), and the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian: izad), meaning 'lord'. In the name "Yeshua Ben Panthera" the Panthera is a Hellenized form of Ptolemaios (Ptolem->Ptol->Panther). "Jesus, son of Ptolemy". This directly connects the "Jesus" figure to the Ptolemaic-Bosphoran royal house. Similar to "Iasus", a Greek figure associated with the Argonauts and "Iaso" the healing Greek goddess.
-    Jew: Iudaeus means "of Jove" which is Jupiter."Jupiter comes from Dyēus Pter ("Sky Father") which is the original name of the chief god for the Proto-Indo-Europeans on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. His name means "Shining Sky Father". The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" (Diespiter -> Iupiter). (J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e., Yahweh/Yhwh. Dyēus -> Zeus -> Iove (Jove) -> Iud- (as in Iud-ii). The -ii suffix denotes "people of" or "tribe of". Iudii = "The People of Jove. "The Scythian elite, as part of their imperial cult, syncretized their primary deity with local dieities. In Anatolia and Thrace, this same god was worshipped as Sabazios, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the Hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus). Dyēus Pter is also at the root of "Yuezhi" (月氏) who were a tribe of Scythians. It appears that ancient "Judaism" (Pre-70 AD) was a branch of the imperial cult centered on the god Jupiter-Sabazios (Yahweh Sabaoth) that local Canaanites, Edomites, and Levantine converts inherited. The term "Ashkenazi" (Ashkenaz means Scythian in Hebrew) confirms steppe origins. 
  - Lord: The term Kavi in Avestan texts (e.g., Yasna 10.6) denotes a divine ruler associated with Aži (dragon/serpent). Translating Kavi to Greek yields Kyrios ("lord"), a title used for Jesus in the New Testament (e.g., Kyrios Iesous). The Scythian title Xšaya (king) appears in Old Persian as Xšayathiya, phonetically linked to Kshatriya (Sanskrit: warrior-king) and Caesar via the Greek Kaesar. A kurgan inscription from Issyk (Kazakhstan, 4th century BCE) mentions a ruler named Ašakavi ("dragon-priest"), combining Aša (truth/order) and Kavi. This title parallels Asander (Thracian: Asa = "lord") and suggests a pan-steppe naming convention for dragon-kings. 
-   Monobazus: Sabazios is the Phrygian and Thracian version of Zeus. The "-zios" suffix refers to Zeus in Thracian.
    Ma'nu comes from Manes/Mannu-Kuras/Manu (Scythian Sage-King)/Menes (Egypt’s legendary founder), and then
    Manu-Sabazios becomes Monobazus. Monobazus also becomes "Bazus" or
    "Bar Izates" shortened to "baYZTus" (or bar YZT) through frequent
    oral repetition which then becomes "bOETHus". The Boethusians were a
    jewish priestly sect.\
-    Pharaoh: not "great house". The root is the ancient Indo-Iranian (Scythian) concept of farnah- (Avestan: xᵛarənah). It means Divine Royal Glory. Phraates (Parthia) and Pharnaces (Pontus/Bosporus) are regional linguistic variants of the this tile (farnah-bearer, or god-king).
-   Piso cognomen: "Appius" is a cognomen (personal name) of the
    Claudian family. Appius and Piso are synonymous (In Greek, Appius is
    rendered as Appios, from there Piso). The name Piso itself would be
    a form of Peisistratos/Pisistratos, the leading name of ancient
    Athens in Greece. (Pisistratos is a Latinized spelling of the Greek
    Peisistratos). It could be said that all the ruling elite of the
    Julio-Claudian dynasty were Pisos, including Nero who was nearly
    deposed by a Piso. Appius is also cognate with Arrius (through
    rhotacization in ancient Latin the /p/ and /r/ could be swapped).
-   Vespasian: Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pasis means "all" in Greek as in Pan. "Vespasian" = "King of All", or "King of Everything" which is a claim to the title "King of Kings". Another option: Vas/Bas = King, and -asian = "of Asia" or "the Asian". Vespasian = "The King of Asia".

2.1 Biblical Figures

The genealogies in Genesis match the Bosporan king list when translated via Greek phonetic equivalents.

-   Adam = Adamas (Greek “unconquerable”) = title of Asander.
-   Noah = Noas (Bosporan king, 1st c. CE also known as Tothorses). ΝΩΑΣ (Noas) is a direct Greek rendering of the Hebrew נֹחַ (Noach).
-   Abraham = Abraamios (a Thracian king in Crimea, known from inscriptions), the father of Issac. Abraamios derives from Ab = Father (Semitic) + Raham = Arya (Sanskrit/Persian: "Noble") + Aram (the name for the land of the Arameans, a steppe-derived people). Abraham = Ab-Raham = "Father of the Aryans" or "Father of the Noble Ones". Related to Brahmin (Brahama) -> Ibrahim -> Abraham. A(Braha)m(in). Lord Rama (the greatest and seventh incarnation of God, hero of the Ramayana, protector of Dharma) in the ancient Vedas derives from this.
-   Isaac = Isaakos (Greek form of “Isaac”) = Iesas (Bosporan prince). Also, remove the Hebrew theophoric Y- = -tzak = Hebrew rendering of Sacae (Scythians).
-   Jacob = Iakobos = a known Bosporan ambassador to Rome.
-   The 12 tribes = the 12 clans of the Sarmatian federation around the Sea of Azov.
-   King David = Diodotos (Bactrian king) = David in Hebrew. Diodotos means "God-given" – identical to Hebrew David ("beloved" but also "given").
-   Moses = Manes/Mannu-Kuras = Manu (Scythian Sage-King) = Menes (Egypt’s legendary founder). Also appears in "Monobazus" → “Manu Bazus” → Sarmatian-Mythological Sage King. The Iranian Manu is a legendary civilizer, and in India he becomes the first Lawgiver (the Manu Smriti = Scythian governance code). The biblical Moses defeats Pharaoh (actually Mitanni elite), parts waters with a serpent-staff—obvious encoding of dragon-kingship (Aži Dahāka). Moses takes on different masks: M enes – the first official Pharaoh (not real, a compilation of conquerors). Menes – the semi-mythical Median king, founder of the priest-class. Mannu-kuras – Proto-Mede, whose name becomes Cyrus. The name Kur-Ash = "Sun Man". The Exodus is not Judaic memory: it's a political memory of Mitanni-Scythian expulsion from Egypt after the religious revolution of Thutmose III → Horemheb wiped them out with a new priest-kingship in Amarna. He shows up in a number of religions: In Zoroastrianism he is Manushchihr, in Hinuduisn he is Manu, in Judaism he is Moses, in Norse mythology he is Mannus, etc.
-   Solomon = Sol-Amūn or "Sun of Amun" which is a direct parallel to "Zeus-Ammon", a title Alexander carried. Also, Solemos is a Greek name for a Bosporan governor.

**3 The Sarmatian Dragon Cult**

The Hyperboreans were a real Bronze Age civilization in the Ural-Volga region of modern Russia who spread their culture southward via the Kurgan hypothesis (c. 4000 BC). They were the survivors of the Doggerland cataclysm (c. 6150 BC), when a submarine landslide (the Storegga Slide) caused a massive tsunami that flooded the North Sea plain. The "Hyperboreans" were the Doggerland elite. The legends of a advanced people "from beyond the North Wind" living in a circular city (Plato's Atlantis) are memories of Doggerland. Their civilization was based on megalithic architecture and a sophisticated, rune-like symbolic language. After the flood, the survivors—the "Dragon Bloodline"—fled eastward to the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, becoming the equestrian Scythians. They carried with them the technology of megalith building (hence Stonehenge, built by their descendants as a memory of their lost homeland) and the core of the "Dragon" religion.

Their descendants were the Scythians. One offshot of the Scythians were a tribe called the Sarmatians (also called Sauromatians
("Saur" = "Lizard/Dragon" + "Matae" = "Men/Warriors" - where the
Sumerian "sar" (king) comes from) who were a nomadic Indo-Iranian warrior
elite from the Pontic steppe (modern Ukraine/Russia). The domestication
of the horse and invention of the chariot allowed them to travel vast
distances and they spread their Draco (dragon/serpent) cult across Eurasia, encoded in snake-worshiping myths [^11] 

The Aryan-Iranian-Scythians were the Egyptian-Persian-Indian-Greek-Roman elite. Egypt, Persia, India, Greece, Rome, etc., were all under the suzerainty of these elites since at least the 40th century BC and their base of operation was on the Bosphorus river.

All ancient Mediterranean religions derive from the
Sarmatian serpent-dragon cult. See: Papaios and the Snake-Legged Goddess (Scythian) = Nehebkau, Uraeus, and Apep/Apophis (Egypt) = Ningishzida (Sumerian) = Tiamat and Mušḫuššu who was associated with Marduk (Babylonian) = Aži Dahāka (Zoroastrianism) later syncretized with Mithra = Ophion, Agathodaemon, Typhon, and Delphi's Pythoness priestess (Greek) = Nāgendra and Nāga (Vedic), Nehushtan/serpent staff of Moses, the Dacian and Roman Draco standards, the serpent-worshipping Essenes and Gnostics, Sebazi (Phrygian/Bulgarian), Jörmungandr (Norse), Ouroboros serpent in Freemasonry, etc. The Knights Templar knew the truth. The Templars worshipped Baphomet—a Sarmatian dragon deity (Aži Dahāka).

Kings who took on the snake/dragon/serpent/Azhi Dahaka title: Azhdahak, which is the Armenian form of the name of the Avestan Azhi Dahaka, was associated with the Median king Astyages (564–550 BC) who was the grandfather of Cyrus the Great. Tigranes II/the Great, King of Armenia (140–55 BC) was also called Azhdahak. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus ('Saur'
means 'lizard' or 'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'). The roots of the snake titles were: Aži-, Azhd-, -zates, Sauro-, Draco-.

The snake was revered by the Scythians for several reasons: apart from symbolism, the Sarmatians used armor that resembled snake skin, the Scythian priesthood called the Agaroi created poisons called "scythicon" from snake venom that they used on their arrows, and snake venom was used as painkillers and stimulants before war. Snake venom was also used to stop battlefield wounds from bleeding, as well as, they were used as anecdotes, as later emulated by figures such as Mithridates of Pontus who daily consumed a potion called "Mithridatium" which was claimed to make people invincible. Also, the foundation myth of the Scythians is that they were created from the Snake-Legged Goddess who was impregnated by Hercules (Targiatos). The name "Scythian" itself decodes as "Scyth" = "Sak" = "Saka" which is related to the word for "serpent" in many Indo-European languages. The Scythians were known as the "Saka" to the Persians, and this term is linked to the Sanskrit "Sarp" (serpent). Thus, the Scythians were the "Serpent People".

-1650-1500 BC: The Hyksos. Aryan Pharaohs of Egypt (Heka-Khasut means "Rulers of Foreign Lands" and Khasut is a cognate of Scythian/Saka, Scyth, Scoloti. Hyksos is the exact Egyptian rendering of Xšaθra).\
-1600-1200 BC: The Hittites. Aryan in Anatolia. Enforcement arm of the Mitanni\
-1595–1155 BC: Kassite Dynasty. Aryan rulers of Babylon after Hittites sacked it.\
-1500 BC: The Mitanni. Aryan horse lords in Syria. Their ruling class has pure Vedic (Aryan) names—Mitra, Varuna, Indra. They are the ultimate horse-lords, and their empire stretches from the Mediterranean to the Indus. The Kassites in Babylon are their vassals.\
-1500 BC: Vedic India. Aryan chariot kings. The Rigveda is their religious text. The term "Aryan" (Noble) is their self-identification.

The Great Upheaval & Reorganization

-1200 BC: Bronze Age Collapse. Mainstream history blames the mysterious "Sea Peoples". The truth is that this was a massive civil war within the Aryan hegemony. Assyria rose up under the Chaldean priests (the Kalani, the Jews). Then the Sea Peoples (Sherden = Sarmatians, Peleset = Philistines = Pelasgians) were Aryan factions from the Aegean and Anatolia rebelling against the Mitanni center. The Dorian Invasion of Greece was not a new people arriving. It was the Aryan-Sarmatian elite of mainland Greece reasserting control after the Mycenaean faction grew weak. The trigger was the eruption of Thera (Santorini) around 1600 BC, which disrupted trade and sparked a bloody power struggle.\
-705-330 BC: Persia’s Achaemenids. Saka (Scythian) clan. This was not a new empire but a reconsolidation of Scythian power under a new clan. The Persians were an Iranian (Saka) tribe. Cyrus the Great's title "Kurush" means "Sun Lord," identical to the Scythian Mithra.\
-616 BC: The Etruscan Tarquin dynasty. The Etruscan Tarquin dynasty seizes power in the Italian settlement of Rome. The Etruscans were not a mystery; they were a Aryan colonial governorate. Tarquin = Tarkhu (Scythian: "Ruler"). Servius Tullius = Tulli (Scythian: "Wolf Clan"). The "Roman" Republic was established as a military-administrative outpost to control the Western Mediterranean and secure tin from Britain.

The Final Consolidation

-650-620 BC: The Reign of Akrosander/Akrosas. The scattered Scythian (Saka) clans are unified under a single "King of Kings," the primordial Dragon-Man. From his Pontic-Steppe core, he forges the first explicit Scythian World Empire, ruling through regional avatars: In Egypt, he is known as Psamtik I, founder of the 26th (Saite) Dynasty. His Scythian name was rendered as "Psamtik I" (Psamtek). The name Psamtek is a Hellenized version of Psam-Tak, which is a Egyptian rendering of Ak-Sam, a metathesis of Akrosas. He reunifies Egypt using Scythian-proxy mercenaries. In Media, he is the supreme overlord Cyaxares, the power behind the Median throne who destroys Assyria. His reign is encoded in myth as the quest for the Golden Fleece and in biblical lore as the prototype for Nebuchadnezzar. This is the foundational event. All subsequent "empires" are either his direct descendants or rebel satraps attempting to reclaim his title.\
-600-500 BC: The Akrosander hegemony begins to fragment, leading to civil wars between his descendant lines.\
-429-339 BC: Ateas the Scythian. The last great emperor of the direct Akrosander bloodline, ruling from the Danube to the Caucasus. His name "Ateas" (Forefather) is a title claiming direct descent from Akrosander. Ateas the Scythian was also Artaxerxes II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") of Persia aka Phillip II in Macedonia aka Nectanebo II in Egypt aka Evagoras I of Salamis (Cyprus).

Ateas and Artaxerxes II Mnemon were reported "enemies" of Phillip. Ateas dies in battle against him, and in the Alexander Romance, a book that has its earliest copy dating back a couple of centuries after Alexanders life, the wizard-pharaoh Nectanebo II is secretly Alexander's real father, magically impersonating the god Amun. This is not fantasy; it is a mythological encoding of historical truth.\

-356 BC: Ateas/Amyntas III/Artaxerxes's grandson Alexander the Great: Alexander was his title. "Aži-ander" = Aži
    (Avestan "dragon") + Andros (Greek "man") = "Dragon-Man", the same as Akrosander/Akrosas. Alaksandu
    of Wilusa, a Hittie king of Wilusa (Troy) (Alaksandu = Alak-San-Du
    (Hurrian: "Ruler-Dragon-Son")), who predates Alexander by 800 years,
    proves that the name Alexander was a Scythian title for kings. In India he took the regional alias of Chandragupta Maurya
    ("Chandragupta" = "Sander-Gupta" (Scythian "Sander" = Alexander. "Aleks" = Greekization of "Alakh" which means "not seen" or "unseen" and in Sanskrit/Hindi "Gupta" = Hidden)). Greek sources (Megasthenes) refer to Chandragupta Maurya as "Sandrokottos" with the Sandro- deriving from Alexandros. Aži-Sandar also = "Dragon King" in Mittani and Old Persian. Recorded in
   the Persian 'Iskandarnameh', or 'Book of Alexander', and 'Shahnameh' and Islamic sources, is that Alexander the Great was a
    Persian prince named Bubares who was the son of Artaxerxes
    II Memnon (Kai Bahman), half brother of "Dara" (Darius III), and that Macedon
    was a province of Persia that his father was governor of.
    Alexander's father Philip of Macedon was Artaxerxes II Memnon's
    regional alias. The book 'The Life of Alexander of Macedon'
    also claims that he didn't die in Babylon in 232 BC at the age of 33
    (same as Jesus) but was only forced from power and he had a
    posthumous birth/'resurrection'.He resurrected in India with the
    regional alias of Chandragupta. Alexander's mother Olympias (Ol or ophis + Pias = "serpent queen"), who was a Scythian princess of the
    Molossian tribe, claimed to have been impregnated by the god Zeus
    Ammon disguised as a serpent. Alexander's fathers name Philip was a title (Philippos (Lover of Horses) is a direct Greek translation of the Scythian royal title Pharnavaz (Horse-Lord)). Alexander also married the Scythian princess Roxana. Alexanders campaign was not a conquest, it was a Scythian restoration. The Achaemenid Persians (Achaemenes is likely Akh-Manesh or "Spirit of Manu", linking to the Vedic sage-king) were a rival Scythian clan (the "Ariya" - Aryans). Alexander was re-establishing the older, purer Scythian hegemony of the Medes and the pre-Zoroastrian Mitanni. In the Old Testament he was Solomon (Sol-Amūn or "Sun of Amun") which is a direct parallel to "Zeus-Ammon", a title he carried. He was also Qin Shi Huang in China. The "King of Kings" and "King of the World" titles Alexander and Cyrus used were literal. They were kings of a global empire.\
-Ateas/Amyntas III/Artaxerxes's other grandson was "Dara" (Darius III) aka Seleucus I Nicator who inherited the vital Eastern territories (Asia). His "father" is listed as Antiochus (of Macedon) and presumed to have been a commoner. The name Antiochus curiously has no definition in Greek, however when viewed as a hybrid Greek-Persian name the meaning is obvious. Antiochus should be parsed as Anti-Ochus, “Like/After Ochus”, that is, continuing the line of Persian Great King Ochus (Artaxerxes III). Ochus, in addition to his ill-fated successor Artaxerxes IV, had many other children. And Artaxerxes IV, although not surviving long as Great King, had many children of his own. Anti-Ochus/Antiochus therefore emerges as a princely son or grandson of Artaxerxes III. (Darius III took on the name Ochus and also had a son by Queen Statiera named Ochus). The name Seleucus (Greek Seleukos), like that of his father Antiochus, has no certain meaning in Greek. (However, compare Greek leukos meaning “white”, and the kingly Roman name of Lucius.) As with the name Antiochus, we must expect some kind of hybrid definition that incorporated a Persian or Eastern element. There is certainly an echo of Seleukos in the later dynastic name Seljuk(os), associated with a people brought from the direction of China to dominate the West. He was Li Si in China who was the advisor to Qin Shi Huang (Alexander) founder of the Qin Dynasty.  \
-Ptolemy I Soter was another grandson of Ateas/Amyntas III/Artaxerxes who received Egypt.\
-305-30 BC: The Ptolemaic Synthesis in Egypt. Following Alexander's "resurrection" as Chandragupta in the East, his bloodline consolidated its rule in the West. Ptolemy I Soter, a fellow Scythian noble and likely Alexander's half-brother, took the Egyptian satrapy. The Ptolemaic Dynasty was not a new Greek ruling class, but the continuation of the Akrosander bloodline using Egypt as its new imperial base.

Thracians/Dacians

-200 BC: The Thracians emerge in the Balkans (200 BC). The Thracian ruling class is Aryan. The most powerful Thracian tribe, the Dacians (or Getae which is linguistically identical to Goth, Get, Jat, and Scyth), become the Aryan power center for Southeastern Europe. The Dacians were the "Wolf Clan" of the Scythian elite who had mixed with the Alani (Aryan). Their battle standard was the Draco—a wolf-headed serpent. This was not just a standard; it was their religious and royal symbol. The capital of the Dacians was called "Sarmizegetusa" (Sarmatian fortress) which contains sar (king). This is where the Latin language originates. Latin was the administrative and ritual language of the Dacian-Thracian Scythian elite. It was not a native Italian language. It was imposed on the Italian peninsula by the Scythian Etruscan and later "Roman" rulers. The reason Romanian is the closest language to Latin is simple: Dacia was a core territory of the empire that spoke a Latinate language natively. Latin is the linguistic fossil of the Scythian ruling class in the West. (interesting fact: legendary King Arthur is a corrupted memory of an Alani Warlord (Artorius), one of the military Kšatrapatis sent from the Bosphorus to secure the lucrative tin and iron mines of Britain after the Flavian consolidation).

The Bosporan and Dacian kingdoms controlled the Danube Delta and the Bosporus Strait—the two most critical chokepoints for Eurasian trade. Whoever controlled these points controlled the flow of goods, armies, and ideas between Europe and Asia. They didn't just rule an empire; they ruled the geography of civilization itself. Also, the massive gold mines of Dacia (modern Romania) were the financial engine of the "Roman" Empire. The output of these mines from 100 BC - 100 AD exceeds the total gold supply of the rest of the ancient world combined. The fact that Asander, king of Bosphrus is today an unknown historical figure despite the fact that he would have been the richest and most powerful man in the word at the time should be regarded as suspictious. The reason why you never heard of him is because you know him under another name: Julius Caesar.

It was a sundial and every city would have had one to track the time, dates, and agricultural and lunar cycles. "Skylesis" a Greek mockery of Skuða-las (Scythian King). The owl on the reverse side is the Owl of Athena also known as the Owl of Minerva, a sacred bird in Greek mythology that accompanies Athena. It shows up prominently in later Greek tetradrachms connecting him to Greece. For a Scythian king to carry that iconography shows direct interaction.

The chromosome Haplogroup R1a, specifically subclade Z93 is found in high frequencies among the Scythian remains from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. The Kshatriya (warrior) caste in India. The Brahmins (priestly) caste in India. The highest nobility of Persia. Patrician families of Rome. The Pharisaic and Herodian dynasties in Judea. The Sarmatian Alans who settled in Western Europe (and whose descendants include the Habsburgs). It is also found in the Tarim Mummies of China and in other tested ancient elite Chinese burial grounds (see: Chapter 7.4 China: The Han Synthesis and the Tartarian Genocide). This is the genetic signature of the administrative and priestly class that was installed globally.).

**4 The Alexandrian School**

In Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter, who was a Scythian continuation of the Sarmatian snake/serpent kings line, used religion to subjugate the vast and disparate peoples he ruled. This was likely inspired by Plato's noble lie which is a concept from his work "The Republic" where he suggests that a myth or falsehood can be used by rulers to maintain social order and promote the common good. The Alexandrian School (Mouseion of Alexandria) then became his religion making factory. He was in the process of creating a universal religion and this was being achieved by gradual syncretism using local identities and blending local deities into syncretic universal savior archetypes (Interpretatio Graecae) as a transitional phase toward a universal monotheism. The Ptolemaic elites were conditioning the disparate populations they ruled into accepting the Serapis cult (sarp- is a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "serpent" as seen in Sanskrit sarpa, "snake". "Sar-Ap" translates to "Serpent-Lord" in Scythian).

![Fig.1.13](/images/SarapisAmunAgathodaemon.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.13 Copper statuette of the god Sarapis Amun Agathodaemon depicted as half-deity. half-snake (Egypt late Hellenistic/early Roman period 1st century BC - 1st century AD).

The Sarapis Cult eventually evolved into Christianity, which was repackaged Serapis cult and targeted at local populations (the Christogram symbolizing Jesus Christ (IHS) = "Isis-Horus-Serapis"). Religion was the technology that the empire used to subjugate the people they ruled.

After the Serapis cult the Alexandrian School made an industry out of taking existing religions and then adding to them a psy-op slave-morality foundation. The goal was to get the population to accept monotheism and move them towards the Sarapis Cult. The Serapis Cult, Gnosticism, Mithraism, Christianity, Manichaeanism, Valentinianism, Hermeticism (Philo of Alexandria’s syncretic philosophy to Hellenize the Canaanite religion of the levant), Buddhism (Pyrrho of Elis's syncretic attempt at subverting the Indo-Aryans in Bactria which was governed by Gaumata Bardya, Cyrus the Greats son), etc., all came from here. 

The director of the Mouseion ("Place of the Muses") and the chief architect of the synthetic religions was not a man. It was a succession of Ptolemaic princesses who held the title The Muse Ourania (The Heavenly Muse). The Mouseion was named after her office. Arsinoë II Philadelphus (c. 316 BC – 270 BC), daughter of Ptolmy Soter, was refered to as "the tenth Muse" and she had a cult dedicated to her as Arsinoë Aphrodite Ourania. in some cases these females directors took on male aliases, for example, Philo of Alexandria was  Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX, Helene, Drusilla of Mauretania, Julia Ourania of Parthia, etc. 

It also seems likely that the Alexandrian School didn't just create religions; it created standardized "national histories". See: Chapters 8. Rewriting History, 8.1. Inventing Ancient Greece, 8.2. The 'Achaemenid' Empire is the Parthian Empire, and chapter 8.3. Fabricating 'Ancient' Egypt.

Ptolemy XII Auletes aka Mark Antony aka Mithridates VI Eupator's son Ariarathes IX Eusebes Philopator, King of Cappadocia (Central Anatolia/modern Turkey) had brothers named Cyrus, Xeres, and Darius. His sisters were named Cleopatra and Mithridates. 

![Fig.1.14](/images/PtolemySoterAuletes.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.14 Coin depicting L. Ptolemy Soter. R. Ptolemy XII Auletes. The 300-year gap between them is likely Alexandrian School fiction. This implies that all "ancient" history before approximately 150-100 BCE is a back-projection. The Alexandrian School (and later Flavian/Vatican/Jesuit forgers) created phantom centuries to give their newly synthesized religions and empires false antiquity. If Ptolemy I Soter = Ptolemy XII Auletes, then his "father" wasn't Lagus (a fictional nobody)—his real father was Ateas the Scythian who was also Artaxerxes II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") of Persia aka Phillip II in Macedonia aka Nectanebo II in Egypt aka Evagoras I of Salamis (Cyprus), and Alexander the Great was a mythological archetype based on Asander aka Julius Caesar, and Dara" (Darius III) aka Seleucus I Nicator was a fictional character based on one of his brothers or his nephew Seleucus VI, ruler of the Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy XII sons under his Mithridates VI Eupator avatar were named Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, and were backdated composites of those Persian kings.

The 'Achaemenid' Persian Empire is a phantom empire. It is a back projection of the Parthian Empire. Cyrus and Darius were composite characters based on the sons of Mithridates VI Eupator. The "Greco-Persian Wars" (5th century BCE) are a mythologized retelling of the Mithridatic Wars (1st century BCE).

They also imbued each history with the same archetypes: A legendary lawgiver (Manu/Moses/Lycurgus/Solon/Numa). A golden age of philosopher-kings (The "Akkadians," "Old Kingdom" Pharaohs, "Athenian Democrats"), an epic struggle against a monstrous Eastern empire ("Persia"), then a civilizing hero who travels and brings wisdom (Osiris/Dionysus/Hercules/Buddha). This was done for archtypical control (centralized texts and priesthoods) and so god-kings could take on these divine roles, and by replacing a cyclical view of time with a linear one this created a sense of "progress" that inherently devalues the past and creates a psychological dependency on a "savior" or a "utopian future"—a dependency they could then fill with their own cults (Serapis, Christianity) or god-kings. 

**4.1 Judaism** 

My research leads me to conclude that the "Jewish" religion was originally the Roman Imperial Cult in Anatolia, adapted to the Galatian Celts so Jupiter became Jupiter-Sabazios (Yahweh Sabaoth). 

Ioudaioi (Jew) does not primarily mean "people from Judah". It means "the People of Jove/Jupiter". The name Jupiter comes from Dyēus Pter ("Sky Father") which is the original name of the chief god for the Proto-Indo-Europeans on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. His name means "Shining Sky Father". The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and I(J)upiter (there was no "J" in ancient Latin) comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" (Diespiter -> Iupiter). I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e., Yahweh/Yhwh. Dyēus -> Zeus -> Iove (Jove) -> Iud- (as in Iud-ii). The -ii suffix denotes "people of" or "tribe of". Iudii = "The People of Jove". The Scythian elite, as part of their imperial cult, syncretized their primary deity with local dieities. In Anatolia and Thrace this same god was worshipped as Sabazios, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the Hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus). 

"Yet Varro, one of themselves—to a more learned man they cannot point—thought the god of the Jews to be the same as Jupiter [deum Iudaeorum Iovem putavit], thinking that it makes no difference by which name he is called, so long as the same thing is understood. I believed that he did it being terrified of his sublimity. Since the Romans habitually worship nothing superior to Jupiter, a fact attested well and openly by their Capitol, and they consider him the king of all the gods, and as he perceived that the Jews worship the highest god, he could not but identify him with Jupiter". (Augustine, De consensu evangelistarum 1.22.30; trans. Stern)

The first Jews who settled in Rome were expelled in 139 BCE, along with Chaldaean astrologers by Cornelius Hispalus under a law which proscribed the propagation of the "corrupting" cult of "Jupiter Sabazius", according to the epitome of a lost book of Valerius Maximus:

"Gnaeus Cornelius Hispalus, praetor peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Popilius Laenas and Lucius Calpurnius, ordered the astrologers by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within ten days, since by a fallacious interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their lies. The same praetor compelled the Judeans, who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius, to return to their homes" ((Valerius Maximus), epitome of Nine Books of Memorable Deeds and Sayings)

The last quote is likely related to this quote from Seneca: 

"When, meanwhile, the customs of that most accursed nation have gained such strength that they have been now received in all lands, the conquered have given laws to the conquerors".

So, they inherited a syncretic local Roman cult, remade it, then began proselysing it to others.

This is proven by the Celticization of the Jewish religion, which would have came from Galatia in classical Anatolia (see chapter: 5.2.2. Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas, King of Galatia). For example, 'Gaulinitis' = Golan Heights. The Celtic languages are surprisingly Semitic with a verb-subject-object word order and a shocking amount of vocabulary overlap, and the name of Irish deities, Balor and his holiday Beltaine are cognate to Bal and Elatha the Irish Uranus is cognate to Hebrew El. King David (DWD) = King Druid. 1 Samuel 16:12 claims that King David had red hair. The ancient Celtic prefixes 'Rab' or 'Rhab' mean 'wise one' or 'seer', and a Druid equates to a Rabbi. There was even a Celtic tribe called the "Iudii" -> Ioudaioi -> Jew. 

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts in Galatia as well who called themselves Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who was Pythagoras's teacher, who was the son of Seuthes (Seth), shows this. The term Abaris was inspired by the Semitic Iber. Iber was sometimes rendered as Aber or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew language. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for Ireland. The word Atlantis means ‘The Island of Atlas’. The titan Atlas was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the  bearer of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia, the Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas where the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.). Dionysius of Alexandria in Egypt (ca. 190-264 CE) also referred to the inhabitants of Britain as Iberi.

'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the ancient Akkadians. The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri, known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks. Cimmerians were a Middle Eastern offshoot of the Celtic Cimbri tribe. 

In Alexandria at the Alexandrian School is where the "Jewish" religion was codified. This is where the Pentateuch and Septuagint were written. The myth of the jewish people and the Laws of Moses were based on Plato's hypothetical colony of Magnesia from his thesis called "The Laws" (347 BC) in which the proposed charter for the Cretan colony of Magnesia was modeled in large part on Athenian legal and constitutional traditions. Ancestor received law from a deity, hereditary priesthood rather than king, as well as the division into 12 tribes were all part of the formula. Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) is where the story of Abraham comes from. Plato's Timaeus is also the source for Genesis 1-11 15. Homer's Odysseey was the source of Genesis 24, 42-46. The biblical concept of hell was stolen from Plato's Replublic ('Myth of Er'), and the spiritual plane of Heaven is ripped off from Plato's 'World of Forms'. Exodus is just a semitized retcon of Jason and the Argonauts, and the Oracles Against the Nations plagiarize the Sibylline Oracles.

Moses = Manes/Mannu-Kuras = Manu (Scythian Sage-King) = Menes (Egypt’s legendary founder), but this name/title was reappropriated for the Sarapis Cult as Moses = Osarseph (Osar (Osiris) and seph (son) = Son of Osirus). The Greek rendering of Moses and Osarseph is identical. Osarseph appears in accounts by the Egyptian priest Manetho, who described him as a renegade priest leading a group of lepers in rebellion, eventually adopting the name "Moses" (Josephus. 'Against Apion' discussing Manetho's account of Osarseph). Osarseph also = Serapis. The "Ser" symbol in Ser-apis is the same as seph meaning "son of". Serapis can be interpreted as "Son of Osiris-Apis", which evolved into "Son of Osiris". So, Serapis is just another word for Osarseph. Solomon = Sol-Amūn or "Sun of Amun" which is a direct parallel to "Zeus-Ammon", a title for Alexander the Great. Abraham: The father of Isaac is Abraham, the foundational patriarch. Ab = Father (Semitic). Raham = Arya (Sanskrit/Persian: "Noble"). Aram (the name for the land of the Arameans, a steppe-derived people). Abraham = Ab-Raham = "Father of the Aryans" or "Father of the Noble Ones". Related the Brahmin (Brahama) -> Ibrahim -> Abraham. A(Braha)m(in).

After the destruction of the Temple and the crushing of the Bosporan‑Adiabene revolt, the Flavians deported or killed the R1a‑Z93 Scythian‑Aryan priest‑elite (the original "Jews"), and then imported loyal temple administrators from client kingdoms in the Caucasus and Upper Mesopotamia: Armenia (heavily J2‑M67/M92), Georgia (high J2a‑M319), and Adiabene/Osrhoene (J1‑P58, J2‑M172). (there were also literal human-neanderthal hybrids [^12] in that region who these "jews" mixed in with).

These people then underwent a genetic bottleneck after the Bar Kokhba Revolt when Emperor Hadrian decimated their population. 

The fact that Ptolemaic/Bosphoran/Roman kings, many who were Celtic Galatians and Aryan Sarmatians, called themselves jews, an irrelevant tribe, and israel was an irrelevant slice of land in the desert, makes the claim that modern jews (who are a mix of multitude of races including non-human Neanderthal) just inherited this imperial cult and they got their
entire identity and history from here more plausable. "Jewish" in the classical sense likely refered to Dyēus Pter (Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Sky Father) or Jupiter, etc. 

**5 Rome On the Bosphorus River**

Much of the history of the Western Roman Empire was conjured up by the Flavians, Church Fathers, Jesuits, Poggio Bracciolini, and medieval forgers,
either to retrofit history to align with the Bible, due to conflicts
between the Vatican and the Eastern Byzantine Church, or for profit.

'Ῥούμα (Rhouma) is documented district in Crimea during the Byzantine period. This is not a coincidence. This is the core toponym. The root of Rome is not Latin. It is the Greek letter Rho (Ῥ), often used to transcribe foreign "R-" sounds, particularly from Iranian/Scythian languages. "Ruma" (Rome) = "Place of the Dragon". This is seen in the Rha (Volga) river which was seen as a great serpent of the earth to the Scythians. 

Rhouma in Crimea was the original power center. Rome on the Tiber in Italy was a Western military-administrative garrison named after the core. Then the Roman (Constantinople-on-the-Bosporus), centered on Constantinople/Bosporus river in modern day Istanbul, was the "third Rome" (Basileía Rhōmaíōn).

The area of modern-day Istanbul was once called 'Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn'
('Kingdom of the Romans') and the people of that region called
themselves Rhōmaîoi (Romans). This is why the Ottomans called themselves "Rum" (Rhome). They knew exactly what they were the heirs to. The Ottomans also called the Balkans "Rumeli", or "Land of the Romans". This is also why every romance language based on
Latin underwent a linguistic evolution except Romanian, which is the
closest language to classical Latin. Bwcause it was the original
"Latin". A substantial part of Byzantine coinage from two millennia ago boasts
inscriptions in Latin and not in Greek, including the Asander of
Bosphorus coin above.

Rome in Italy was real, but it was a province, a frontier military district (Limes) of the true Empire based on the Bosphorus. It was never the center of power it was made out to be. Its "fall" was the loss of central control from the East and the rise of local Gothic/Sarmatian warlords (Theodoric, etc.) who still tried to cloak themselves in the legitimacy of the Eastern Koryllis.

Also, Carthage was not a Semitic power. The name "Carthage" comes from "Kar-Thaga" - "City of the Thagians" (a Scythian tribe). Hannibal's family name, Barca, means "Lightning" and is a title of the Dragon King. Rome vs. Carthage was not a clash of civilizations. It was a bloody civil war between two Scythian-descended factions for control of the Western Mediterranean. The winner, Rome, wrote the history and painted the losers as monstrous foreigners.

**5.1 Julius Caesar aka Asander, King of Bosphorus aka Mithridates Chrestus**

There was a Bosphoran [^13] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^14] took
on the role of Asander (also Asandros), King of Bosphorus [^15] ("Asa"
means "lord" in Scythian/Thracian and serpent in Scythian (Scythian Assaioi: As-saioi = As is Scythian for "Serpent Lord", and Sai refers to clan/tribe. Sar means king in Scythian), and "andros" means "man" or "son of
man" in Greek. Jesus is referred to as "the son of man" 81 times in the
four canonical gospels. Asandros can also be interpreted as either "Dragon Man" (the same as Aži-ander, or Alexander), or "son of the
lord", or "son of Asa, the lord", or "Lord King". The Thracian version of Zeus was Asa. The
Etruscan word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar" which likely
derives from the Egyptian "Asar" which was another name for Osiris - there
was no J in ancient Latin, so it was pronounced ah-soos)
from which Asa may also derive, means "god" or "divine". Asandros can
also possibly translate to either "son of god", or "son of Lord Aesar/Asar
(Osiris)". The Greek language often added the prefix "K" to words
borrowed from other languages, so Aesar ("god") -> Greek Kaesar ->
Latin Caesar. Both Asander and Caesar are titles meaning "Lord King" in their respective languages (Scythian and Latin) but deriving from the same Indo-European root for king.

Cleopatra used the regional alias of Dynamis Ourania [^16]
(translating to 'heavenly power'), queen of the Bosporus. Cimmerian
Bosporus approximates to modern-day Crimea in southern Ukraine (see
also: Jesus Christ Was Born in Crimea by Anatoly Fomenko).
 
 Asander was born in 110 BCE, the same year as Julius Caesar. Dynamis was
born in 70/69 BCE, the same year as Cleopatra VII. Julius Caesar was 30
years older than Cleopatra, and Asander was also 30 years older than
Dynamis.

A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17
BCE), refers to Asander as the "Great King of Kings Asandros
Philoromaios Soter" (Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani 30). So, he
was a 'King of Kings', Soter (savior), and 'The Great'. Individually,
each of those titles carries significance, for example, the title "King of Kings" (Shahanshah) originated in ancient Persia, notably with the Achaemenid Empire, and was adopted in Parthia. For a ruler to claim it means he was either declaring himself the equal to the Persian or Parthian emperor or, more likely, was the Persian or Parthian emperor himself but the 'Great King of Kings'
title in that inscription stands out because it is a rare title that only two other historical figures carried and they were Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great, so this shows Asander's
level of prestige and power to be placed alongside those two. Julius
Caesar is the only historical figure who had a comparable level of
prestige as Cyrus and Alexander.

Asander was also called Asandrokhos (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390912485Aspurgos-the_king_of_Bosporan_state_98_BC-_AD_38). The -Khos in Scythian is xsha/khsha which means "power, dominion, rule". It is the direct root of Xšayathiya (Persian "King"), Kshatriya (Sanskrit "Warrior-King"), and Caesar (via Kaisar). The suffix -khos is a Hellenized form of this root. The Kushan Empire (1st-3rd c. CE) claimed descent from the Yuezhi (Jove/Jupiter). Tiberius Julius Aspurgus, king of Bosphorus aka Emperor Tiberius calls himself the son of "the great king of Asandrokhos" in an inscription. He was Kujula Kadphises, prince of the Kushans in Bactria.

One of the main conspirators in the assassination of Julius Caesar was named Gaius Trebonius. In the Bosporus, the historical record states that around 17 BCE, a usurper named Scribonius appeared, claiming to be a relative of Asander's wife, Dynamis. He seizes power and Asander, in despair, commits suicide. "Trebonius" and "Scribonius" are linguistically congruent. This is obviously a literary trope, or imperial fiction. 

**5.1.1 Julius Caesar was a Title**

Identifying Julius Caesar as Asander of Bosphorus necessitates a
re-examination of his name.

Galata in Classical Anatolia was settled by the Gauls. Galatia bordered
the Bosphorus, and Julius Caesar/Asander was king of this region.
"Gaius" then can refer to Asander's connection to the Gallian (Gauls
(Galli = Celt in Latin)) people or his ancestry in the region.

Ceasar's gentilice (surname) was Iulius. Iulius comes from Dyaus Pter (the sky god, same as Zeus, Jupiter - the name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" (Diespiter -> Iupiter)). So Iulius = Dyaus -> Iou-Pater -> Iu-Piter -> Jupiter -> Iulius. The name means "of Jupiter". "Iulius" (Julius) is related to "Iove" (Jove) which is the Roman equivalent of Zeus, and would have been pronouced Yahweh in the Latin language.

The supreme deity of the Roman state was Jupiter Optimus Maximus (Jove).

The Egyptian name "Asar" was another name for Osiris. "Ra"
    was the Egyptian deity of the Sun (Asar-Ra). This title very likely
    connects to "Asar-Hapi" (Osiris-Apis), another name for the
    Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis (Osiris + Apis = Osorapis). The Etruscan
    word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar"), meaning god or
    divine, likely derives from the Egyptian Asar. The Greek language
    adds a "K" to foreign words, so Aesar -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin
    Caesar. This title also resembles the the Scythian/Hurrian "Kur-Sar" (Sun King) and the Phoenician "Kosar" (sun god). In Celtic cultures,
Caesarus also referred to a Celtic chieftain who likely took on a divine
role. For example, Caesorix was the leader of the Cimbri tribe during
the Cimbrian War.

Gaius Julius Caesar was a title, and Gaius Julius Caesar could
conceivably translate to: Chieftain of the Iudii or Iudaiei tribe from
Galatia, or Lord Asar/Aesus (pronunced ah-soos) of the Iudii or Iudaiei
tribe from Galatia.

Russian historian and mathematician Anatoly Fomenko wrote several books
where he claimed that the city of Yoros = Jerusalem = Troy and it was
situated on the eastern, Asiatic shore of Bosphorus, closer to the Black
Sea, very near to the Beykoz mountain (Golgotha). 

**5.1.2 Julius Caesar aka Asander's Suspected Aliases**

Asander beat Mithridates Chrestus in battle to become King
of Bosphorus. After Mithridates Chrestus's loss to Asander he was
imprisoned and executed by his elder brother, Mithridates VI Eupator,
who had previously beat him in war.

![Fig.1.145](/images/MithridatesChrestus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.15. Mithridates Chrestus aka Ptolemy of Cyprus aka Asander, king of
Bosphorus, etc. The names Asander and Caesar both derive from the Etruscan word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar" which likely derives from the Egyptian "Asar" which was another name for Osiris - there was no J in ancient Latin, so it was pronounced ah-soos). He would have been the first person to take on the title Iesus Christ. Asander is recorded to have beat Mithridates Chrestus in battle to become the king of the Bosphorus.

diminutive of 'Iehuva' which traces to Jove/Jupiter. Juba I was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal. Juba II was the biological son of Cleopatra aka Dynamis and her father Ptolemy XII Auletes aka Mark Antony aka Mithridates VI Eupator. Juba II is titled "Ptolemy" upon accession in Mauretania.

Wikipedia says that he was the son of Amyntas Nikator, but Amyntas Nikator was the son of Ptolemy XII Auletes aka Mark Antony aka Mithridates VI Eupator and his sister-wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena of Egypt, so Apollodotus was his uncle. (see: Chapter 5.3.2. Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas, King of Galatia).

**5.2 Cleopatra VII aka Dynamis Ourania aka Pythodorida Philometor**

Cleopatra VII was the archtype, not the avatar, for the "Jesus" figure. She was the living Soteira (feminine Soter), Thea (Goddess), and "Queen of Kings". She was the descendant of the Scythian Dracaena, or the snake-legged goddess who was the mother of the Scythians in mythology.

however, even in the elder Dynamis bust you can see her lazy eye and
abnormally large eyes which she was reported to have had, possibly as a
consequence of inbreeding. The hat she is wearing is a Phrygian cap, a
distinctivehat that is closely associated with the Roman god Mithras.
Dynamis was recorded as being of "Sarmatian" ancestry.

![Fig.1.28](/images/cleopatra.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.28. (L) Julia Mamaea, Queen of Pontus (wife of Polemon II), (R)
Cleopatra VII. Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus was a regional alias
of Julius Caesar/Asander (as Asander and Polemon were both married to
Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She
would have been married to her half-brother (Cleopatra and Mark Antony's
son) Polemon II, King of Pontus aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka
Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of the
Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next to the Pontus Kingdom

Dynamis's father was Mithridates VI Eupator who also carried the title
"King of Kings". Her uncle was Mithridates "Chrestus" [^17]. The name
Mithridates (more accurately, Mithradates) is the Hellenized form of the
Indo-Aryan Mithra-Datt, meaning "One given by Mithra". Mithra is the
Indo-Aryan sun-god and Datt ("given by") derives from the
Proto-Indo-European root da ("to give"). That name was born by a large
number of kings, soldiers and statesmen in the Iranian dynasty of the
Parthians and mostly by the royalty and nobility in Asia Minor.

Mithridates VI Eupator beat his brother Mithridates Chrestus in war to
become king of Pontus/Bosphorus. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the
city is founded as the result of a fratricide, with the twins Romulus
and Remus quarreling over who has the favor of the gods and over each
other's plans to build Rome, with Romulus becoming Rome's first king and
namesake after killing his brother (mirroring the biblical account of
Cain and Abel).

Mithridates VI, king of Pontus, was the father of both Pharnaces II and
Dynamis (Cleopatra). Pharnaces II was Ptolemy XIV who was Cleopatra's
brother-husband.

**5.3 Dragon Bloodline Descendants**

**5.3.1 Ptolemy XII Auletes aka Mark Antony aka Mithridates VI Eupator**

The throne name of Ptolemy Philometer was Ir-maat-en-amun-re. This
    would strengthen the word play between the names Philo-meter,
    Mithra-dates, and Matthath-ius. (The Egyptian Maat-en transliterates
    to the Hebrew Mattan/Mattath and the name "metor" transliterates
    into Parthian Mithra). Philometer then corresponds to Mithradates of
    Parthia and Mattathius the Hasmonean. (Mattath is the Hebrew
    feminine form of Mattan).\
    
He was also likely Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the 'Sons of Ptolemy'), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc., and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^18]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

![Fig.1.29](/images/PtolemyXII.jpeg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.29. Ptolemy XII Auletes, king of Egypt, who was also Mithridates
VI Eupator, Ariarathes IX of Cappadocia, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al. Mithridates VI married his sister
Laodice---just as Ptolemy XII married his sister Cleopatra V. Both had
daughters named Cleopatra who ruled (Cleopatra VII and Dynamis).

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy XII Auletes/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesar's life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^19],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^20], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania.

His sisters were named Cleopatra and Mithridates. In Chapter 8.2. I write that the'Achaemenid' Persian Empire is a phantom empire. it is a back projection of the Parthian Empire. Cyrus and Darius were composite characters based on the sons of Mithridates VI Eupator\

Pharnaces II flees and is killed by his own governor, Asander, who then becomes King of the Bosporus. This was not a succession; it was an avatar switch. Pharnaces II called himself "King of Kings" on coinsas Asander did.

Fig. 1.34. Coin depicting Ptolemy Apion, king of Kyrene, Kyrenaica, North Africa. 

**5.3.2. Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator aka Gaius Octavius (Emperor Augustus) aka Rhoemetalces I**

Augustus was not a name. It was a title. The title Augustus was translated into Greek as Sebastos. Related to the Thracian deity Sabazios. Sabazios -> The "-zios" suffix is a divine marker (like in Zeus). The core is Saba- or Saba-zd-. In Greek pronunciation, the 'b' (beta) was a voiced bilabial fricative (like a 'v'), so it could shift. Sabazios is where the Hebrew Sabaoth ("Lord of the Hosts") comes from.

Zalmoxis was another name of Sabazius, the Thracian version of Zeus. Also, Zalmoxis or Zalmox or Zalmos can also be pronounced Salmos which is very close to the Aramaic and Hebrew pronunciation of Solomon.

He was also Rhoemetalces I, king of Bosphorus. Talces = the Thracian word for "king" or "ruler". Rhoemetalces = "king of Rhome", or "king of Rome" in ancient Thracian.

Bazus is the direct truncation of "Sabazios". It's the royal, dynastic form of the god's name. Bazus is at the root of the title Monobazus.

Sebasteia or Sebastē was also a city in the heart of the Pontic-Bosporan kingdom.

Sazios was the Thracian Zeus equivalent to the Roman Jupiter. The Sabazios cult was the imperial cult rolled out for the Thracians. 

**5.3.3. Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas, King of Galatia**

Amyntas Nikator (Latin Invictus which links him to Sol Invictus) aka Amyntas of Galatia [^21] aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen (Jesus was named "Amen" in Rev. iii. 14 and Amen links to Egypt through the name of the pharaoh Amenhotep). Amyntas's father was not Bogitarus. That is a later, localized alias. His true father was Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus (aka Ptolemy XII Auletes/Mark Antony/Herod). Mithridates VI Eupator's father was Mithridates V Euergetes. Mithridates V Euergetes's father was Pharnaces I of Pontus. Pharnaces I's brother was none other than... Amyntas of Pontus. The name "Amyntas" is a family heirloom, used for a brother of the king. For "Mithridates VI" to have a son named "Amyntas" is perfectly consistent with dynastic naming patterns. He was not the son of a minor chieftain; he was a scion of the primary Dragon Bloodline. His brother and heir to the dragon throne was Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator aka Gaius Octavius (Emperor Augustus) aka Rhoemetalces I.

Amyntas of Galatia's mother was simply named Adobogiona. There was an "Adobogiona the Elder" who was a Galatian princess who was a recorded mistress of Mithridates VI Eupator, so it is safe to assume these two are the same woman. Her true imperial title was Cleopatra V Tryphaena of Egypt, the sister-wife of Mithridates VI/Ptolemy XII. This makes Amyntas of Galatia/Nikator the full brother of Cleopatra VII Philopator (Dynamis).

He was also Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen. The name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Celtic and Persian "Bagus" means god. "Boga" in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona "Bog-" means god in Celtic. In Latin Nikator translates to Invictus which liks him the the deity Sol Invictus. "Jesus ben Bagus" means "Jesus, Son of God", or  "Jesus, Son of The Lord".

"Bagha" (Old Persian), "Baga" (Avestan), "Bhagavan" (Sanskrit) all mean "Lord", a title for God. It enters Persian as "Baga" (as in the city Baghdad, "Given by God"). He is known in Indian sources as "Amita", from which "Amyntas" derives, but also as "Moga" or "Maues," the first Saka (Scythian) King in India. He was also associated with the Mên Askaênos cult of Antiochia Pisidia which echoes the name of the Indian king Asoka the Great.

Islamic tradition holds that Jesus (Isa) was a prophet born of the virgin Maryam, who did not die but was raised to heaven. "Maryam" is not a Jewish woman. It is a title for the Mari, the Scythian "Mother Goddess" worshipped by the Anatolian Celts. Amyntas, as the son of the Celtic princess Adobogiona, was literally the "Son of the Mari." His "ascension" refers to his assumption of the "Hidden Lord" (Amen) kingship after a period of conflict.

Amyntas's mother Adobogiona was a "Jewish Queen" and the "Celtic Goddess-Queen" at the same time, proving Jew: Iudii -> Ioudaioi -> Jew. The Iudii were originally Scythian-Celtic priests from Galatia who later became "Jews" under Alexandrian syncretism. 

Amyntas was the brother of Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator aka Gaius Octavius (Emperor Augustus) aka Rhoemetalces I and Alexander, son of King Herod aka Alexander Helios aka Juba II.

Amyntas ruled an empire that stretched from modern-day Turkey through India, but likely further as his reign coicides with the "Yellow Emperor" Zhao of Han, an archetype that he fits perfectly with.

His palace at Isauria refers to Isis (also known as Isa or Aset) who was the mother of Horus (Cleopatra identified herself with the Greco-Egyptian goddess Isis and in Egyptian mythology the son of Isis was Horus), and Jesus is called Isa in the Quran. -Ura is a city suffix so this makes "Isaura" (Isa-Ura) literally "Jesus City".
 
Galatia = Galilee: The names are linguistically identical. "Galatia" is the Greek form of "Galilee." His kingdom was the biblical "Galilee".

This would mean that Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus (aka Ptolemy XII Auletes/Mark Antony/Herod) was also Brogitarix, king
of Galatia (Full name: Brogitaris (Brigatos) van (de) Celtes
Trocmii:"Bogo-" is related to the Proto-Celtic word "bog-", which means
"god" or "divine". "-diatarus" could be connected to the Latin word
"diatus", meaning "divine" or "godlike", the Old Irish word -tairx means
" lord"."Van" or "de" is a preposition indicating "of" or "from",
which suggests that Brogitaris/Brigatos is the divine leader or a member
of the Celtes Trocmii which refers to the Trocmi, a Celtic tribe that lived in ancient Galatia). 

**5.3.3.1 Was Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas, King of Galatia the Living Esus?**

The Celts in classical Galatia worshiped a deity called
Aesus/Esus/Iesus. Amyntas, as the god king of Galatia would have been the personification of Esus. "Esus" from "Aisus (Thracian Jove-variant). Esus is the Celtic pronunciation of Aisus. The Scythian root is Aes-, the same as the Aesir and Aesar. "Iesus" is the Latin rendering of "Esus." There was no "J" sound. He was always called Ie-Sus (Yay-soos), "The Esus."

![Fig.
1.35](/images/Esus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.35. Statue from classical Anatolia that is dedicated to "Esumopas
Cnusticus". Esumopas means "Slave to Esus", and Esus means lord in
Proto-Celtic. If you combine the Etruscan word "cnus" with the suffix
"-ticus" or "-tic-" you get a word that translates to "anointed one" or
"consecrated one", ie. a "Christ". So, that inscription translates to:
"Slave to Lord (Esus) Christ". The "VSLM" inscription is an abbreviation
for the Latin phrase "Votum Solvit Libens Merito" which translates to
"He pays his vow willingly and with merit" or "He fulfills his vow with
pleasure and deserving", which is often found on Roman coins and other
artifacts. Esus was crucified in mythology and his symbol was an axe, so
he was associated with woodcutting, forestry, carpentry. Esus was also
part of a "trinity" of Gaulish gods that included Taranis, Teutates and
Esus.

The "Esus" cult was the Celtic-language version of the Serapis cult, rolled out under Amyntas. It follows the precise theological blueprint developed by the Alexandrian School for imperial control. The template is unmistakable: "Es" is the same root as "Aesir", "Asa", and "Osiris". Divine Birth/Lordship: "Esus" from aisu ("lord") mirrors "Serapis" from aser ("lord") and "Christ" from Kristos ("anointed lord"). Crucifixion/Resurrection: Esus's T-cross crucifixion parallels Attis's pine-tree death, Osiris's dismemberment, and Dionysus's dismemberment by Titans. Sacrificial Symbolism: The labrys (double-axe) represents the same sacrificial logic as Mithras's bull-slaying and Osiris's grain symbolism. Trinitarian Structure: Esus-Taranis-Teutates mirrors Osiris-Isis-Horus, Serapis-Isis-Harpocrates, and the Christian Trinity.

Like Serapis (Osiris+Apis), Esus represents a deliberate syncretism—in this case, merging the Celtic god of the axe with the Phrygian Attis (dying-and-reviving god) and Thracian Sabazios (Thracian horseman god, another form of Zeus). The dominant local Anatolian deity would have been Attis and Esus was the deity of the Gauls who settled in that area. 

The "Esumopas Cnusticus" inscription proves this was a state-sponsored imperial cult, not organic Celtic religion. The original Esus was a warrior. The new, syncretic "Esus Christos" was a god who was crucified on a T-shaped tree (a clear parallel to the Tau cross). The message to the fierce Galatian Celts was: "Your god is not a warrior, but a sacrificial victim. True strength is in submission, sacrifice, obedience, and turning the other cheek".

**5.3.4. Alexander, son of King Herod aka Alexander Helios aka Juba II**

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with her father Mark Antony [^22] (aka Ptolemy XII Auletes aka Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus, prince of Pontus aka King Herod aka Tiberius
Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) was Alexander Helios aka
Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his twin
sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva' which traces to Jove/Jupiter. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal (one way to prove that Mark Antony was also King
Herod is through the equivalence of Alexander Helios aka Alexander (son
of King Herod) aka Juba II).

Alexander Helios's father was  Mark Antony who officially was declared Neos Dionysus (the "New Dionysus"), a dying-and-reviving god. His mother, Cleopatra VII, was the New Isis, the mother goddess. Therefore, Alexander Helios was, in the state religion of the Ptolemaic-Roman East, the literal divine son of a god and a goddess. This is the precise theological template for the Christian "Son of God".

Alexander, son of King Herod and Juba II were both married to Glaphyra of Cappadocia. Alexander Helios was married to his twin sister Cleopatra Selene II, Queen of Mauretania, who was also married to Juba II.

Alexander, son of King Herod, was allegedly killed by his father Herod, but Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death, so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

I identify Cleopatra's brother-husband Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator as Gaius Octavius (Emperor Augustus) (aka Polemon I of Pontus. Gaius Julius Sohaemus of Emesa. Rhoemetalces I, king of Bosphorus). Rhoemetalces Philocaesar of Pontus was the son of Marcus Antonius Polemon Pythodoros who was married to Pythodoris I (Cleopatra). Polemon I of Pontus was married to Dynamis (Cleopatra). Cleopatra was married to her brother Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator who was born at the same time as Augustus. He was her brother husband. Asander was also married to Pythodoris I and Dynamis proving these were Cleopatra's aliases. So, was Alexander, son of King Herod aka Alexander Helios aka Juba II also emperor Augustus? If not, he was his brother, as well as, the brother of Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas, King of Galatia.

Was he also Jesus ben Panthera? "Panthera" is a Hellenized corruption of "Ptolemaios" (Ptolem -> Ptol -> Panther). "Jesus, son of Ptolemy". The Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus the "Sons of Ptolemy".

**5.3.5. Aliases and Avatars of the Bloodline**

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony = Ptolemy Philadelphus who
was Sampsiceramus I?

Mark Antony's son with Livia Drusilla = Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Augustus (one way to prove that Mark Antony was both King Herod and
Tiberius Claudius Nero is through the equivalence of Doris the first
wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
Octavius/Caesar Augustus (the Greek name Doris is a transliteration of
the Roman Drus-us). Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but was
divorced and he became engaged to Livia Drusilla (Doris), who was at the
time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband Tiberius
Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius
Nero, praetor of 62 BC).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria' (aka Julius Philo, of the Julia gens, because she was the
adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar). She was also Claudius and
Nero's secretary Pallas and Vespasian's first cousin and mistress
Antonia Caenis. "The full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas,
with the Antonius part being an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony
and that Pallas wasn't a random slave. (Philo's hebrew name was Yedidia
which means"beloved of God", or"friend of God", which is the same as
Theophilos in Greek. Around 26% of the New Testament was written to
Theophilus in Luke and Acts of the Apostles).

Alexandria's son. Tiberius Julius Alexander's son was named
'Philopappos' and one of his mother's aliases was 'Alexandria bat
Matthias' which is where the pseudonym 'Joseph bar Matthias' comes from.
Also, drop the initial b and final s in the name "Bar Mathias" and you

an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning 'lord'. He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image

Fig. 1.39. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus, who was the
son of Tiberius Julius Cotys (aka Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius
Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Emperor Nerva), great-grandson of
Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Does he look
familiar? ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ in the above coin translates to "King of
the Sauromatians". Sauromates is a Greek rendering of 'Sarmatian',
referring to the Scythian tribe who came from the Pontic steppe. 'Saur'
means 'lizard' or 'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'.
Therefore, translated literally ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ means "King of the
lizard people", or "king of the dragon people". But note that his father was Tiberius Julius Rhoemetalces and Rhoemetalces translates to "King of Rhome" in ancient Tracian. Also, at the root of Sauromates is "ROM"? If Sauromatians or Sauromates originally connotated Rome/Rhome/Rum (Saromates: Sar- = King, -oma- = Rhoma, -tes = of = "King of Rome"?) then this would prove my theories beyond any doubt. He was the grandson (or great-grandson?) of Ptolemy XII Auletes aka Mark Antony aka Mithridates VI Eupator and his daughter Cleopatra aka Dynamis.

Acanthus leaves symbolize rebirth, immortality, and the cyclical nature of life in art and architecture. Acanthus leaves are often used in Christian art to depict the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

(Kanishka = "Khan-Isha" (Scythian: "Khan-Lord")) was an emperor of the Kushan dynasty (modern day Afghanistan through India). This would mean that the Flavians only seized the western administration and rewrote its history. The eastern administration (Kushan) continued the old system for centuries. Kanishka I was the leader of the "Yuezhi" ("Iudii"/"Jove") tribe.

Bar Kokhba means "Son of the Star" which directly links to the "Star and Crescent" symbolism on the coins of Asander/Julius Caesar and Dynamis/Cleopatra. He led the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 AD) against Rome. As heir to the dragon crown he would have had a claim to the emperor position.

(a) Apollonius of Tyre was married to the daughter of a king of Libya
    ("Historia Apollonii Regis Tyri" or "The Story of Apollonius, King
    of Tyre"), who was Cleopatra Selene aka Drusilla (aka Cleopatra
    (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka
    Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria. Drusilla was the
    wife of Azizus who was her brother Juba II (Alexander Helios aka

    So, Alexander aka Juba II was also Apollonius of Tyre. Juba II
    carried the title "Rex Literatissimus" which can be translated as
    "Most Learned King" or "The Most Scholarly King". He was known as a
    philosopher. These members of this royal family liked to role-play as philosopher kings. Is Apollonius of Tyre the same person as Apollonius of
    Tyana? This would make Apollonius of Tyana the brother-husband of
    Philo of Alexandria and the father of Josephus. These three created
    the core of Christianity.\

**6 Flavian Dynasty**

Vespasian was also a great-grandson of Cleopatra and Mark Antony (King
Herod). He was Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King
Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Vespasian was his title, not his name
(Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which =
King, and Pas means "all" as in Pan. "Vespasian" = "King of All", or "King of Everything" which is a claim to the title "King of Kings") [^26]. Another option: Vas/Bas = King, and -asian = "of Asia" or "the Asian". Vespasian = "The King of Asia". He was also
'Flavius Scaevinus' the conspirator involved in Nero's assassination.

'Antonia Caenis' was Vespassian's mistress who was his first cousin who
was Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo
of Alexandria. (Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a
man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo).

Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene
aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of
Alexandria aka Antonia Caenis's son was Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Josephus who was the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard which made
him arguably the most powerful man in the empire during Vespasian's
reign.

Vespasian's son Titus was in a relationship with his aunt Berenice,
granddaughter of King Herod, who was St. Veronica in the bible (Veronica
is a transliteration of the Greek name Berenike meaning 'victory').

Berenice's brother Marcus Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an
incestuous relationship with before moving on to her nephew (previous to
this she was married to her uncle Herod of Chalcis), was the governor of
all foreign Roman territories except Egypt (which was governed by
Tiberius Julius Alexander) during the Flavian period.

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesar's adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister).

    Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka
    Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka
    (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of

    after which, Tigranes VI (Tiberius Julius Alexander) was installed
    as king. Compare his bust [link] to the famous 'Josephus'
    (Tiberius Julius Alexander) bust [link]. Notice a resemblance? If
    this is correct, then he (Alexander) would have been the
    brother-in-law to Caligula and father-in-law to Domitian. Tiridates
    of Armenia (who would have been Mithridates Chrestus'
    great-great-grandson) was the one who spread the religion Mithraism
    which was a syncretic a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired by Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter.\

**7. The Demographic Erasure of the Scythian-Aryan Hegemony**

If the Scythian R1a-Z93 "Dragon Kings" controlled a global empire, why are their genetic descendants not dominant from Britain to China today? The answer reveals the most successful geno-political engineering campaign in history: a multi-phase protocol of systematic replacement that was the true purpose behind the Flavian historical forgery.

**7.1 The Flavians (c. 50 BCE – 300 CE)**

What seems plausable is that the "Aryan hegemony" of the ancient world was not a monolith, but a network of interrelated clans (Saka, Sarmatian, Cimmerian, Parthian, etc.) who often fought for supremacy within the hegemony. For example, the "Persian" conquest by Cyrus was not a new empire but a coup d'état by one Scythian clan (the Achaemenids/Persians) against the ruling Scythian clan (the Medes). The "Greco-Persian Wars" were a civil war between the Western satrapy (Greece) and the Eastern core (Achaemenid Persia). So, in the "Jewish-Roman" Wars (who were Celtic Iudii Jupiter worshippers, unrelated to modern "jews") the Flavians did not put down a provincial revolt. They launched a blitzkrieg against the core Eastern administration, and this destroyed the Scythian steppe hegemony. The Flavian dynasty then, after defeating the Judean-Adiabenean forces in the Great War (66-74 AD, mislabeled the "First Jewish-Roman War"), took their primary political enemy, King Izates II, and rewrote his cult as pacifist allegory to subvert the people of his kingdom using the same Alexandian School formula they used in all their imperial cults. They also rewrote history to erase their Bosphoran origins. 

Roman emperor faces no longer appear on Bosphoran coins after emperor Titus. Roman emperors also stopped looking "Aryan"/Nordic after the Flavian empire.

The Flavians (Pālava or Palavi/Pahlavi, which was the term for the Parthian/Iranian aristocracy) were a Sauromatian clan who broke away from the old R1a-Z93 royal Bosphoran line (the Sauromatians proper) and introduced a heavy J2/J1 (Jewish haplogroup) admixture from the Adiabene–Osrhoene region. The haplotype R1a (the famed "Arya" gene) was the dominant haplogroup of the Roman elite before the Flavian empire. After the Flavian reign the haplotype J2/J1 became the dominant haplogroup among the Roman elite [^37]. This drop in R1a correlates with the rise of "Eastern" (Anatolian/Syrian) emperor origins.

This is why they erased the Scythian origins of ancient civilizations and painted the Scythians (R1a) as monstrous foreigners. 

**7.2 China: The Han Synthesis and the Tartarian Genocide**

The Scythains ruled a Eurasian empire that stretched into China. 

Azhi = Asia (Azhi-A) = "land of the mighty dragon" (Aži is cognate with the Chinese Zhī (dragon)), a very similar name as Rome (Rhu-Ma) = "Place of the Dragon", Romania (Rhu-Ma + Na) = "dragon land", and Sarmatia (serpent) + ma (mother, land). The Chinese dragon, a symbol of imperial power, is a direct descendant of the Scythian Draco standard, carried by Sarmatian cavalry and adopted by the Han dynasty.

The Tarim basin mummies are Tocharians, and the Kizilgaha cave portraits deprict redheaded “Chinese” people. Genetic studies show that indegenous people of Linzi in south east China were genetically more similar to Europeans than modern Chinese [^28]. Tang dynasty mural in tomb unearthed in China portrays a ‘Westerner’ man with blond hair [^29].

Alexander the Great = Qin Shi Huang (China’s First Emperor). Both "died" mysteriously at 33 (Alexander in 323 BC; Qin Shi Huang in 210 BC). Alakshandra (Sanskrit) → Qin Shi Huang (Chinese): The "-shandra" morpheme appears in "Shi Huang”" meaning "First Guardian". Qin was founded by Alexander, it starts right exactly around the Greco-Bactrian city states era in Central Asia, it was started by people coming from the West right exactly bordering Central Asia during Greco-Bactrian rule, DA-QIN meaning BIG OR GREATER QIN as a word name term was used to refer to the Roman empire during the "Han dynasty" that came after Qin dynasty which means the QIN people had to have been Greco-Bactrian Seleucids since they equated with Roman type people and they came from the farthest West direction. 
Qin’s terracotta army has Caucasian features and Hellenistic armor. The character "Qin" (秦) is written with the radicals for "grain" and "man," but its Old Chinese pronunciation was Dzin. This is a direct phonetic match for the Latin Ianus (Janus) and the Sanskrit Yavana (Ionian Greek). The Qin were the Yavanas—the Greeks—from the West. Their sudden rise, standardization of weights/measures, and great wall-building are all hallmarks of an Alexandrian-style conquest state. Greek style coins and statues have been found from this time period, and the terracotta army was built by Greeks from Central Asia [^30], to this day the Chinese currency which came about formally during Qin dynasty era is called a YUAN which is another name for YON-IONIAN Greeks etc.

Julius Caesar aka Asander, king of Bosphorus was Prince Jin Midi in China. Jin (金) means "Gold," a royal Scythian attribute. Mi (日) is "Sun." Di (磾) is a rare character meaning "black," but also a homophone for "Emperor" (帝). His story: A noble "barbarian" prince from the West (Xiongnu confederation, which included Saka/Scythians) is captured and rises to become the most powerful man in China, serving as regent to a child emperor. This is the exact same narrative archetype as a foreigner (Caesar) rising to power in Rome.

Emperor Tiberius aka Tiberius Julius Aspurgus I, king of Bosphorus was the Chinese emperor Yu the Great. He was also Kadphises, prince of the Kushan Empire. Kujula Kadphises unifies the Yuezhi tribes and establishes the Kushan Empire right after the "death" of Julius Caesar/Asander. The "Yuezhi" are the "Iudii"/"Jove" tribe—the same Scythian-Celtic priestly class. "Yazhi" (亞茲)) = Julius, from Ioulius, related to Iove (Jove). Iove is linguistically linked to the Scythian tribal name Yuehzi (Yuezhi). He is "The Jove/Yuezhi King".

China had no chronology until the Jesuits came to the Emperor’s court. Their oldest "ancient" records date from this period. Stone inscriptions and bronze engravings and a few bamboo slips survive from older times, but they were never arranged into a consistent chronology. If you read the Bellum Tartaricum, a pre-edit Jesuit source, it gives a very different chronology as well as info about the white Slav-like race known as the Tartarians, their rulers and their wars with China. The Jesuits essentially wrote early Chinese history for them. They "reconstructed" the Xia and Shang dynasties based on fragmentary records, arranging them to fit the Biblical timeline. Mateo Ricci invented Confucius and was the one who retroactively attributed 'The Art of War' to Sun Tzu. The Art of War was originally a Flavian-era strategic treatise on psychological warfare and systems control (the exact principles the Synarchy used to manage its global hegemony). Martino Martini (1614-1661) wrote 'Sinicae historiae decas prima' (1658) - the foundation of all Chinese chronology.

The modern "Han Chinese" are not infact "Han" or "Chinese" ("Chinese" is an identity fabricated and conjured up by Jesuits) but are infact Miao-Hmong people. Han comes from Ahan (Aryans) of Buddhist texts who were related to the Scythian Yuezhi/Kushan rulers. The real Han = Yangshao R1a (90% steppe, 5000 BC), purged in the An Lushan Caucasoid genocide. Genetic studies show the Yangshao culture (5000 BC) had 90% European DNA (Haplogroup R1a). The modern Han are Miao who migrated from Vietnam after the Mongol invasions.

The An Lushan rebellion was an ethnic war, mongoloids vs caucasoids which resulted the slaughter of millions of caucasians [^31]. The Xianbei were mongoloids and helped rape and sexually enslave Indo Europeans in China in the An Lushan rebellion. Goguryeo Korean general Gao Juren in the Tang dynasty committed genocide and rape against An Lushan’s community after defeating An Lushan at his headquarters in Fanyang (Beijing).

Similarly, Ran Min slaughtered and committed genocide on the entire Caucasian Jie people who were native to Chin, and the Manchus had the Central Asian Indo-European children castrated. 

Then Mao-tse Dong used artificial weaponized famines and outright direct purges to direct human wave attacks in the Korean war to mass kill off original Scythian Tartar Turanian stock authentic real “Chinese” populations which is continuing today with the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Uighurs and Mongolians whom are far more genetically ancestrally connected and linked to the original real actual ancient “Chinese” rather than a vast majority of modern “Han Chinese” whom are actually Miao-Hmong or Miao-Tse or Hmong or Yao or other southern origin non-“Chinese” group pretending to be "Chinese".

**7.3. Ancient India: The Mauryan Mirage**

The "Mauryan" Empire is a Flavian/Vatican fabrication. Chandragupta Maurya is Alexander the Great.

Alexander was an Aryan dragon-king who was the grandson of Ateas the Scythian aka Artaxerxes
    II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") and half-brother of Darius III ("Darab").
    In India he took the regional aliases of Chandragupta Maurya
    ("Chandragupta" = "Sander-Gupta" (Scythian "Sander" = Alexander. "Aleks" = Greekization of "Alakh" which means "not seen" or "unseen" in Sanskrit/Hindi. "Gupta" = Hidden)). Greek sources (Megasthenes) refer to Chandragupta Maurya as "Sandrokottos" with the Sandro- deriving from Alexandros). "Aži-ander": Aži
    (Avestan "dragon") + Andros (Greek "man") = "Dragon-Man". Ptolemy I Soter was his biological son with Barsine (Scythian priestess) and was his dragon-born
heir, and Caesar was their bloodline successor. The Persian narrative is
a Flavian forgery to hide their stolen legacy. Alexander conquered
Persia as vengeance for Persian enslavement of Scythia.

In the book the Alexander Romance, a book that has its earliest copy
dating back a couple of centuries after his life, Alexander accepts
mortality only after achieving complete satisfaction in his conquests.
In the so-called apocryphal accounts Alexander sails up the Ganges River
and reaches a kind of Paradise after the conquest of all India is
complete. He is not literally granted eternal life there, but
nevertheless fulfills his goal of reaching this remote and privileged
locale. In the Romance, Alexander also lives to play a part in the lives
of the next generation of princes, who have grown to maturity and are
even married when he visits them in the south of Egypt.

The conqueror of the Indian sub-continent is known by a different name,
Chandra-Gupta, one of the most celebrated kings of all of Indian
history. Curiously, almost nothing is known about his early life until
after the death of Alexander the Great. No sooner did the attempted
conquest of Alexander end than that of Chandragupta began. There is a claim by
ancient rulers of Bukhara/ Bochara on the Silk Road (in Sogdiana) that
they were descended from Alexander -- a claim which becomes far more
credible (and even inevitable) when one realizes that Alexander's life
did not end in Babylon and his dynastic line did not actually die out
(See also: "Alexander and Chandragupta in Sanskrit D" by Ranajit Pal
[32]).

Chandragupta Maurya/Alexander's successor in India was "Bindusara" (whose
name derives from Vindusara (Sanskrit: "one whose essence is poison", a
nod to the Mithridatic lineage. Also, Bindusara was called "Amitrachates". This name connect to Mithridates (Amitra (A-Mitra) + -chates which is a direct phonetic variant of -dates)) who was either Heracles/Helios, Alexander's
son by Barsine, or Alexander IV, Alexander's son by Roxana. Bindusara =
Ptolemy II Philadelphus (also Ariarathes III of Cappadocia? -
"Arya-Ratha". Sanskrit: "Noble Charioteer").

Alexander's successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, then became the
successor to Bindusara and ruled India with the regional identity of
Ashoka the Great (See: "Diodotus I was Ashoka" by Ranajit Pal
[^33]).

Mithridates I Ctistes (also known as Mithridates III of Cius) was a son
of Alexander's son Heracles/Helios, who was born to Alexander and his
mistress Barsine.

Antiochus I Soter = Darius III, Alexander/Artaxerxes II
Memnon/Chandragupta's brother.

Bubares [^34] was a Persian prince who
married Alexander's sister. They had a son named Amyntas (son of
Bubares) [^35]. He
was the king of the city Phrygia that was located in Galatia in
classical Anatolia. Bubares, the Persian prince, was Alexander's Persian
identity. Amyntas (son of Bubares) (born around 350 BCE) =
Heracles/Helios (born around 350 BCE) = Mithridates I Ctistes (born
around 350 BCE)?

The name Abaris or Abharas, from Abaris the Hyperborian, the teacher of Pythagoras, derives from the Old Scthian word abhar, which means chief or noble. Abharas is also related to the Sanskrit word Bhārata, a legendary king in the Vedas. Bhārata is at the root of the word Bharatvarsha which is a term that is used to refer to the Indian subcontinent as a whole. 

The Jewish scholar Flavius Josephus (37 – 100 AD) quotes from Clearchus’s fragment in his Contra Apionem [Against Apion], in which Aristotle says: “Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their name from the country they inhabit, which is called Judea.” (Book I:22.) Megasthenes (350 BC - 290 BC) recorded: "The Jews were an Indian tribe or sect called the Kalani" (also Kaldu).

Calami is a village located in the Kannur district of Kerala,
    southwest India. Kochi, also known as Cochin, is a major port city
    in the state of Kerala. Cochin is obviously phonetically related to
    the name Cohen 

Lost in history is that the greatest slave trade wasn't the Trans-Atlanic one, but the jewish (Calami) ran transfer of Ethiopians into India during the spice and marble trade. Dravidians are Ethiopians who the jews imported into India via South India and Sri Lanka. There is a straight line route from Ethiopia to Sri Lanka via boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves then mixed with indigenous Australoid/Denisovans
    who were similar to Australian Aborigines. Eventually they mixed with the indigenous Scythians (likely by force and genocide run by the Calami).

**7.4 The Middle East and North Africa: Invasions and Slave Colonization (250 - 650 CE)**

The destruction of the Aryans in the Middle East and North Africa was done in three phases:

1 The Goths were not primitive invaders. They were a Scythian remnant group (Goths = Getae = Scythians) weaponized by the Eastern Empire (Constantinople/Adiabene faction) to destroy the Western R1a aristocracy. The sack of Rome (410 CE) and the conquest of North Africa by the Vandals (a Sarmatian elite leading a mixed army) were false-flag operations to clear the land.
    
2 The "Justinianic Plague" (541-549 CE) was a Bioweapon: Recent genomic analysis shows the 'Yersinia pestis' strain was not endemic to Europe. It was introduced via the Egyptian grain trade, controlled from Constantinople/Alexandria. It disproportionately ravaged the densely populated, still-R1a-heavy cities and army camps of the old empire. This was a demographic reset.
    
3 The "Arab Conquests". The armies were multi-ethnic slave-soldier forces (Ghilmān), but their core leadership was not "Arab." It was the J2/J1 Adiabene-Makkedan nobility (the "Quraysh")—the same priestly-financier class that had served the Flavians.

Their primary targets were not cities, but the countryside—the latifundia estates still held by the old R1a landowning families. Systematic slaughter of adult males, enslavement of women and children.

The Arabs also engaged in slave breeding. Cities like Basra and Kufa were not military camps; they were human hatcheries. The scale is understated. Estimates based on tax records suggest 5-7 million East African (Zanj) and Caucasian slaves were imported into Mesopotamia and the Levant between 700-900 CE. The "Arabization" was, in fact, the 'Zanj-ization' of the population base.

Subsequent "Arab" invasions were clean-up operations. |

**7.5 Where Did The Scythian Aryans Go? The Refugia**

The Scythians did not completely vanish. Some were pushed to the geographic and social margins:

1  Mountain Refugia: The Pashtuns (R1a-Z93 >40%), Pamiri peoples, Kalash, Druze, Maronites, Kabyles, Basques (high R1b, but of the older, non-steppe variant). These groups often have oral traditions of "fleeing the lowlands".

2  Caste Systems: In India, the Brahmins and Kshatriyas retain significantly higher R1a-Z93 frequencies than lower castes. The caste system fossilized the genetic hierarchy just as the replacement wave hit.

3  The European Nobility: A fraction fled west, becoming the nucleus of the "Gothic" and later "Frankish" nobility. Their "divine right of kings" was a corrupted memory of the Dragon King mandate. This explains why medieval European royal lineages are obsessed with Trojan (i.e., Anatolian) and Scythian origins.

4  The Ghetto and the Diaspora: Some of the defeated R1a elite were absorbed into the Jewish communities of the Diaspora as converts, explaining the presence of R1a lineages (like R1a-YP263) in Ashkenazi Levites—a conquered priesthood absorbed by the victorious priestly class.

The "Great Replacement" is not a modern theory. It is an ancient, completed historical fact. The peoples now called "Arabs," "Turks," and "Middle Easterners" are largely the successful result of this replacement—a slave-soldier derived population ruled by a priest-financier elite that orchestrated the downfall of its former Scythian masters.

The victors then wrote the history, claiming the cultural achievements of the defeated (Pyramids, Philosophy, Law) as their own, and painting the Scythians as barbarian nomads or mythological monsters (Aži Dahāka, Gog and Magog).

**8. Rewriting History?**

The Alexandrian School moved history back 300-500 years. They invented the ‘Achaemenid’ Empire as a mirror of the Parthian Empire. Then they invented Egyptian history to give their satrapy a pedigee. 

Then the Flavian dynasty (Vespasian, Titus, Domitian) and their court historians (Josephus, Pliny, Tacitus) created a "Roman" history to legitimize their new dynasty and obscure their Bosphoran/Herodian origins. Josephus aka Tiberius Julius Alexander was prefect (governor) of Roman Egypt and had control of the Library of Alexandria, and likely was the one responsible for buring it down. 

According to the book 'Jesus, King of Edessa' (2012) by Ralph  Ellis [^36] Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel who led the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70 AD) against Rome was also Jesus ben Sapphias and Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. King Izates of Monobazus was a descendant of the dragon bloodline and was married to the sister of Dynamis's mother. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II or his father or grandfather could have also been Simon bar Kokhba (Bar Kokhba means "Son of the Star" or his son which directly links to the "Star and Crescent" symbolism on the coins of Asander/Julius Caesar and Dynamis/Cleopatra) who led the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 AD) against Rome. 

What seems plausable is that the "Aryan hegemony" of the ancient world was not a monolith, but a network of interrelated clans (Saka, Sarmatian, Cimmerian, Parthian, etc.) who often fought for supremacy within the hegemony. For example, the "Persian" conquest by Cyrus was not a new empire but a coup d'état by one Scythian clan (the Achaemenids/Persians) against the ruling Scythian clan (the Medes). The "Greco-Persian Wars" were a civil war between the Western satrapy (Greece) and the Eastern core (Achaemenid Persia). So, in the "Jewish-Roman" Wars (who were Celtic Iudii Jupiter worshippers, unrelated to modern "jews") the Flavians did not put down a provincial revolt. They launched a blitzkrieg against the core Eastern administration, and this destroyed the Scythian steppe hegemony. The Flavian dynasty then, after defeating the Judean-Adiabenean forces in the Great War (66-74 AD, mislabeled the "First Jewish-Roman War"), took their primary political enemy, King Izates II, and rewrote his cult as pacifist allegory to subvert the people of his kingdom using the same Alexandian School formula they used in all their imperial cults. They also rewrote history to erase their Bosphoran origins. 

Roman emperor faces no longer appear on Bosphoran coins after emperor Titus. Roman emperors also stopped looking "Aryan"/Nordic after the Flavian empire.

The Flavians (Pālava or Palavi/Pahlavi, which was the term for the Parthian/Iranian aristocracy) were a Sauromatian clan who broke away from the old R1a-Z93 royal Bosphoran line (the Sauromatians proper) and introduced a heavy J2/J1 (Jewish haplogroup) admixture from the Adiabene–Osrhoene region. The haplotype R1a (the famed "Arya" gene) was the dominant haplogroup of the Roman elite before the Flavian empire. After the Flavian reign the haplotype J2/J1 became the dominant haplogroup among the Roman elite [^37].

This is why they erased the Scythian origins of ancient civilizations and painted the Scythians (R1a) as monstrous foreigners. 

**8.1 Ancient Greece**

Not only is Western Rome a phantom empire, so was the "Classical Greece" of Pericles, Plato, and Aristotle. It is a literary and philosophical back-projection, created by the Flavians and later Renaissance humanists. Its purpose was to provide a "noble pedigree" for the Western Roman Empire, separating it from its "barbaric" Scythian roots. The works of Plato and Aristotle are not the products of a 5th-4th century BC Athenian democracy. They are the synthesized theological and political philosophy of the Alexandrian/Bosphoran intellectual elite, likely compiled between the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD at the Alexandrian School in Egypt, and then retroactively attributed to fictional "Greek" sages.

There is no physical manuscript of any Greek classic (Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles) that predates the 9th century AD. The earliest fragments are papyri from Roman Egypt (1st-3rd c. AD). The entire corpus was "preserved" by Byzantine monks and then "rediscovered" by Italian humanists like Poggio Bracciolini in the 15th century. Bracciolini was a known forger and had both motive (Medici patronage) and opportunity (access to the Vatican's scriptorium) to produce these texts.

Plato's "Academy" was the Alexandrian School. "Plato" is not a man. The name is a title. "Plato" (Πλάτων) derives from "Plouton" (Πλούτων), an alias for Hades, the god of the underworld who possessed the riches of the earth. "Ptolemy" (Πτολεμαῖος) derives from Ptole- (war) but is phonetically and functionally identical to "Plouton-Maios" (The Rich One).

**8.2 The 'Achaemenid' Empire is the Parthian Empire**

In Persia, the "Achaemenid Empire" is a phantom, a Flavian-era literary creation designed to provide a grandiose, conquered enemy for "Alexander the Great", and push the "center" of ancient power further east, away from the Bosphoran core. There are no coins issued in the name of "Cyrus the Great", "Darius I", or "Xerxes". The entire empire, supposedly the largest in the world, allegedly functioned for centuries without a coinage system. The coins we attribute to them are misdated Greco-Bactrian and Parthian issues. Cyrus the Great is a mythological amalgamation of several Scythian warlords, including the historical Mithridates I of Parthia and earlier Saka kings like Megabyzus. There are no contemporary records of Cyrus.

The "Achaemenid" Empire perfectly mirrors the Arsacid Parthian empire if you factor in "phantom time".

Cyrus the Great (c. 550 BC) = Mithridates I of Parthia (c. 171 BC) - Founder of the Parthian Empire.	Both were "Great Kings" who establish a vast Persian empire from a minor satrapy.

Darius I (c. 522 BC) = Mithridates II of Parthia (c. 124 BC) - Consolidated the empire and organized it.	Both are master administrators who create the classic "Persian" imperial structure.

Xerxes I (c. 486 BC) = Salamis	Orodes II of Parthia (c. 57 BC) - His general Surena annihilates the Roman army at Carrhae.	Both launch massive, failed invasions of "the West" (Greece/Rome). The "Persian Wars" are the Mithridatic Wars.

Zoroastrianism was invented by the Sasanian Empire (3rd-7th C. AD). They needed a state religion to rival Christianity and legitimize their rule. They systematically compiled older Iranian oral traditions and created the Avesta as a "holy book". To give it antiquity, they back-dated Zoroaster to a mythical past (6000 BC). In doing so, they plagiarized the life story of a real person: Pythagoras (Both Pythagoras and the Zoroaster of legend are said to have traveled to Egypt and Babylon for wisdom. Both are masters of occult knowledge and ritual purity. Both believe in the transmigration of souls).

**8.3 Fabricating 'Ancient' Egypt**

In Egypt the "5000-year" history of Egypt is a Flavian-era fabrication to provide a deep, mystical past for the Serapis cult.

The "Pharaohs" of the Old and Middle Kingdoms are fictional proto-avatars, backdated to create a lineage for the living god-kings like the Ptolemies and Caesars.

The "Old Kingdom" is a fictional pre-history for the Serapis Cult. The Pyramids are not 2500 BC tombs. They were built in the 3rd-2nd Century BC. The Scythian Kurgan is the architectural and theological prototype for the Egyptian Pyramid. The reason carbon dating gives older dates for the mortar is because they used fossilized limestone as a key ingredient, a technology now lost, which throws the isotopic readings wildly out of sync.

**8.4 The Vatican-Medici-Jesuit Forgery (14th - 18th centuries)**

A clandestine cartel of Venetian and Genoese merchant-banking families, in collaboration with certain Vatican factions, orchestrated the bulk of the "rediscovery" of antiquity in the 15th-16th centuries. From roughly 600–1200 CE almost all ancient texts survive only via monasteries.

They didn't just forge texts; they forged entire material cultures. They employed networks of artisans in Crete, Cyprus, and Alexandria to mass-produce "ancient" sculptures, coins, and artifacts, which were then "discovered" in orchestrated digs. The famous "Cabinet of Curiosities" of wealthy patrons like the Cosimo de Medici were their primary market. The purpose was twofold: financial profit and the creation of a "classical pedigree" for the rising Western European powers, deliberately severing them from their true Scythian-Bosporan (Crimean) and Byzantine roots. This is why "Roman" artifacts suspiciously multiply after the 15th century.

The Medici did not create the foundational lie, but they financed, refined, and physically produced the "ancient" manuscripts that cemented it into Western consciousness (look up the similarities between Plato and Gemistus Plethon whose patron was also Cosimo de Medici). Their forger-in-chief was Poggio Bracciolini. Poggio Bracciolini who held the position of Apostolic Secretary to the Pope which gave him access to the Vatican Library and is who is the one creditied with "rediscovering" most ancient manuscricts from antiquity. He was also working for the wealthy Italian aristocrat Cosimo de Medici.

**8.5 The Jesuit Operation (16th-18th c.)**

Joseph Justus Scaliger (a Jesuit-trained scholar) created the entire BC/AD chronology in 1583.

Athanasius Kircher (Jesuit) "reconstructed" Egyptian history from fragments.

Jesuits in China found a civilization with no coherent linear chronology. They took fragmentary records, king lists, and bronze inscriptions and arranged them to fit the Biblical timeline provided by the Septuagint.

Jesuits in India back-dated Sanskrit texts by 1,500+ years.

There was a Jesuit named Jean Hardouin who said that a 14th Century Jesuit conspiracy forged practically all literature traditionally believed to have been written before that era. He was the official librarian to the King of France. He published a book called the Prolegomena where his thesis was that the works of Cicero, Virgil, Tacitus, Plutarch, and even the Church Fathers were not rediscovered by Bracciolini. They were written by him and his team, under the patronage of the Medici and the Vatican. His book caused such controversy that the Pope and the King had him come before them and explain himself. He defended his work, and refused to retract it, so they threw him in prison.

**9 9\. Identifying the Flavian Scribes**

It is possible to identify who wrote the bible by looking at sects of the Imperial cult. 

**9.1 Christianity**

Sometime after the Roman-Jewish wars the Flavians tried to subvert the eastern imperial religion and they created christianity. It seems likely that the Bosphoran imperial religion before Christiantiy was essentially Judaism (see: Chapter 8. Who Forged History?). The Flavians took this religon and they infused a slave morality into it. 

The primary architects were Flavian court historians Josephus and Pilny the Younger, but one other person who had a hand in writing the New Testament was named Epicteus (See: "Epictetus and the New Testament" by Douglas Simmonds Sharp (1914)) who was the slave to Nero's scribe Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus or Epaphroditos (c. 20–25 – died c. 95). Epictetus had a Roman teacher named Gaius Musonius Rufus (c. 20-30-died c. 101) who was a Roman Stoic philosopher. Gaius Musonius Rufus was also a teacher of Dio Chrysostom (c. 40 – c. 115 AD). Josephus opened his book "Jewish Wars" and "History of the Jews" (Antiquities) by addressing them to: "kratistos (most excellent) Epaphroditus".

Epicteus and Pilny the Younger were both in the same places at the same time; Rome, Nicopolis, and Bithynia-Pontus, and Pliny the Younger was a Roman administrator in Bithynia and Pontus at the same time Marcion was in Sinope, so these people knew each other.
 
Epictetus (c. 50–135) fits the typecasting of a rabbi named Akiva (c. 50–135). If Epictetus = rabbi Akiva then this would put all the pieces together. 

Rabbi Akiva was a teacher of of a man named Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos. The midrash
(Tanhuma. 41a, Mishpatim 3) claims that Onkelos was a nephew of Hadrian
and other jewish sources list him as a nephew of emperor Titus (Tractate Gittin (56b)). His other student was Markianos of Alexandria
aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, also, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter
(Shimon bar Yonah) (Simon's mythology was stolen from the Roman deity
Janus who was the keeper of keys/gatekeeper role. Eusebius reported that
Philo had met Simon Peter in Rome), Ketia bar Shalom aka 'Clement of
Rome' (hebrew Ketia is the same as Latin Clement), Aristo of Pella who
is a good candidate for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or
'Ariston' is a name that is related to 'Proteus' The former means
'first-rank, noble' the second derives from 'first'. So, was he also
Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or Mahalia, sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem
was the secretary of Aristo and Marcion is known to have had a disciple
named Lucanus as documented by Tertullian, so Mark, or Mahalia, first
Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion
of Sinope?), Rabbi Yehuda aka Jude the Apostle (Yehuda is the Hebrew
equivalent of Greek Jude), and Rabbi Meir aka Polycarp aka Bishop
ignatius (the name "Meir" means "one who illuminates". Ignatius means
firey one and Polycarp was famous for lighting himself on fire).

Rabbi Akiva was likely Paul the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 "Paul" claims to
have been educated at the feet of Gamaliel (who was likely Tiberius Gemellus who was the grandson of Emperor Tiberius and brother of emperor Caligula) who was the teacher of rabbi
Akiva, and in Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed that
Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul the
Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.
Paul's/Saul's fictional life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian
story"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor".

If "Jew" = Jove/Jupiter before the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) and Flavian revision, and Judaism was essentially the Cult of Jupiter, then it wouldn't have been unusual for these people to call themselves Jewish despite being genetically Scythian-Sarmatian or Celtic. A "Rabbi" was just a prist in the Flammin Dialis cult. 

Quintus Tinnius Rufus (Turnus Rufus the Evil) would have been Pontius Pilate, the
Roman governor of Judaea who crucified Simon bar Kokhba and killed rabbi
Akiva. Rabbi Akiva preached that Simon bar Kokhba was the jewish
messiah.

Zeus became Baal-Zebub in the bible: Zeus Belos (Greek: Zeus Baal) ->
Baal-Zebul -> Baal-Zebub ("Lord of the Flies") in 2 Kings 1:2-3.Jesus
calls Satan "Beelzebul" (Matthew 12:24)---a deliberate mockery of
Zeus-Baal. Scythian Sar (king) became Esau (Edom) the progenitor of the
Edomites in the bible, a metaphor for the forces of oppression and
injustice. Saka (Scythian tribe) is a near-perfect homophone for the name of Satan (adversary). The Jewish
version of Antichrist (Armilus) is based on Romulus (Armilus is a Hebrew
corruption or adaptation of the Latin name Romulus). Lucifer, or "lucem
ferre", which means "light-bearer" or "morning star", is Venus who was
the Roman goddess whose functions encompassed love, beauty, desire, sex,
fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the
ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas. The Greco-Egyptian
deity Serapis (the horned deity) became the image of Satan. Sin (also called Nanna or Suen) is a Mesopotamian god of the moon. He was worshiped as the lunar deity whose symbol was the crescent moon. Sin was considered the son of the sky god Enlil and the grain goddess Ninlil, and the father of the sun god Shamash (Sumerian Utu) as well as the goddess Ishtar (Inanna). Together, Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar formed an important astral triad in Mesopotamian religion. In Norse
mythology Iðunn/Idun (equivalent to Greek Hebe, and Celtic Brigid), is
the goddess of youth, her name means "giver of eternal youth". The other
gods get golden apples from her. She stores them in a basket and they
keep the gods young until the end of the world. Idun became Eve in the
bible the archetypal sinner whose actions brought death into the world
(Romans 5:12). Inanna (equivalent to Freyja (Norse mythology), Aphrodite
(Greek mythology), Venus (Roman mythology), and Morrigan (Celtic
mythology)), the ancient goddess of war, love, and fertility, became the
Whore of Babylon (Friday the 13th was the day to honor Freyja). Artemis,
the goddess of the wilderness, wild animals, nature, vegetation,
childbirth, care of children, and chastity, became recast as a witch
(19:24). (The demonization of Venus (lucifer), Idun/Hebe/Brigid,
Inanna/Freyja/Aphrodite/Venus, Artemis, and other female Pagan deities,
was designed to instil a strong hatred of women among European men). The
Mark of the Beast (666) refers to emperor Nero (take Nero's name and
title in Greek (Nero Caesar), and transliterate it into Hebrew and then
take the numerical value). Also, the jews' hated enemy in the bible are
the Celts (Gog or Goy). Flavius Josephus in the 'Antiquities of the
Jews'. Book I. Chapter 1: "For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now
call Galatians [Galls], but were then called Gomerites. Magog founded
those that from him were named Magogites; but who are by the Greeks
called Scythians". Josephus is suggesting that the Hebrew word "Goy"
(meaning "nation" or "people") is related to the Greek word "Galatae"
(meaning "Gauls" or "Galatians"), In biblical prophecy, Gog is described
as a leader from the land of Magog in the north, who will gather a
coalition of nations to attack Israel, but will be defeated by God in a
great battle.

**9.2 The Cult of Antinous**

Two years before the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE) emperor Hadrian created a
religion to deify his underage gay lover as the son of god
(Osiris-Antinous) called 'The Cult of Antinous'. The name "Antinous" is an obvious indication of descent from the Antonii line and that he was a descendant of Mark Antony himself, not a random adoption by Hadrian. The use of "-ninus" is really the Greek "nini", which is "baby" or infant (i.e., "baby Jesus"). Historian Cassius
Dio claims that Antinous was offered as a human sacrifice to Hadrian (Cassius Dio Cocceianus, Historiae Romanae, book 69, chapter 11) and later was "resurrected". Antinous was likely Emperor Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius, who was adopted by Hadrian and was his successor, and the cult of Antinous was his imperial cult. One of the scribes for The Cult of Antinous was Aquila of Sinope aka
Onkelos who was a kinsman of the Roman emperor Hadrian. Emperor
Hadrian also employed Aquilla of Sinope to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia
Capitolina after the Bar Kokhba revolt (the city was named after Hadrian's family name (Aelia) and the Roman god Jupiter (Capitolina)). In Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed
that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul
the Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus"

**9.3 Islam**

Islam is a surviving (albeit subverted) sect of the original Bosphoran Imperial Cult.

King Izates of Monobazus's (Isa in the Quran) son was named Zamaris (Zamaris the Babylonian jew) and Zamaris has the same meaning as Muhammad.

In the book 'Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World' (1977) by Patricia Crone and Michael Cook they trace the origins of Islam to 'The Secrets of Shimon bar Yochai' [^38] which is a record of the "divine visions" of the 2nd-century rabbi, Simon ben Yohai aka Simon Peter (Shimon bar Yonah) who was a student of rabbi Akiva, to his students. They theorize that Islam was started as a psy-op to weaponize the Arabs to attack the Byzantine empire (eastern Rome) to free judea. 

Shimon bar Yohai wrote that his "secrets" were revealed to him when he was hiding in a cave on account of the persecutions of Caesar king of Edom (Rome). His secrets were his blueprint for the destruction of Rome (Esau/Edom) and all western "gyrwn" (Aramic form of goyim) through using "Ishmael" (Arabs) and "four-arms" (Indians).

According to his prophecy, after Ishmael weakens Edom (Rome) and then "dies a noble death", the jews would import millions of four-arms ("Chaturbhuja" in Sanskri means "four-armed" and many Hindu deities are depicted with four-arms, including Vishnu) to dilute the Roman population and finish the job.

In Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai stated: "Kill the best of Gentiles, smash the head of the best of snakes". He was the biggest proponent of the belief that Rome was Edom.

Allah and Muhammad the red-headed warlord then became parodies of Attila the Hun [^39] and his uncle Ruglia waging war against Rome (Edom) because they wanted the Arabs to attack eastern Rome. 

So, Talmudic jews who were hiding out in the Himyarite Kingdom after
Emperor Hadrian kicked them out of judea, and who were students of Rabbi Akiva, basically just cut-and-pasted
from one of the Bosphoran/Adiabene/Roman imperial cults of the time and created two sects: Christianity as a
slave morality/proto-Bolshavism for the Romans and Islam as a warrior morality to weaponize the Arabs to attack Rome. It is impossible to get people to abandon their religions for a new one, so they created sects of one of the popular religions at the time and infused the trojan horse ideology into it.
This conspiracy was so sophisticated that not only did they rewrite the
imperial cult, but they rewrote history to align with their psy-op.
Josephus's (Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Emperor Nerva) works were
rewritten by Rabbi Akiva's students under the alias Hegesippus. The book
'The Antiquities of the Jews' then became a pseudo-epigraphical work (of
propaganda) that was backdated to make christianity look legitimate in
the same way that the 'Letter of Aristeas' was backdated to exaggerate
the age of the Septuagint. 

Endnotes (Chapter 9)

(a) Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria grew up in the
    Attis-Sabazios cult on Anatolia before traveling to Judea to study
    under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian
    School.\
(b) There was a Marcus who founded the Marcosian Gnostic sect. He was a
    teacher of Bishop Irenaeus and a friend of Clement of Alexandria.
    Was he also Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria?
    [^40]. St. Jerome
    in "Against Jovinian" describes Mark as a disciple of the Gnostic
    teacher Basilides. Here is a list of "Marks" who were active around
    the same time: Mark, the Evangelist, John Mark, Mark of Apollonias,
    Markianos of Alexandria, Mahalia, Marcus of Jerusalem, Marcus
    Pompeius, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, Marcus the Magician, Marcion of
    Sinope, Marcus the Marcosian. Mark of Apollonias, John Mark, Mark
    the cousin of Barnabas, and Mark the Apostle are considered to be
    the same person by historians, so it is conceivable that all these
    "Marks" were the same person.\
(c) In 41 A.D Emperor Claudius sent a letter of warning to the Jews in
    Egypt (preserved in a papyrus now in the British Museum, R Lond.
    1912), where he described them as "the fomenters of a universal
    plague throughout the civilized world.". He eventually expelled them
    from Rome:
    [^41]
    In the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 18:1-18) it explains how the
    Apostle Paul met Priscilla and Aquila and mentions in passing an
    expulsion of Jews from Rome. "Paul" was Rabbi Akiva and Aquila of
    Sinope aka Onkelos was his student. So, it is possible that the
    conspiracy even pre-dated the Bar kohiba revolt. Previous to this,
    Valerius Maximus, in his work 'Facta ac dicta memorabilia', mentions
    the expulsion of Jews from Rome in 139 BCE by the praetor peregrinus
    Cn. Cornelius Hispalus for attempting to currupt the cult of
    Jupiter.[^42]\
(d) Quintus Tineius Sacerdos, the brother of Quintus Tinnius Rufus, was
    the governor of Pontus in Anatolia, so the family likely derived
    from there. Pilate means the temperament of a warrior I.e., famously
    temperamental. That's where the name Pontius Pilate comes from.
    *Pilate might also = "Pileatus" (Latin for "wearing a felt cap," a
    Pontic priestly garb associated with Mithraism).

Pope, *Jesus Among the Julio-Claudians* (2017); and "How Fake Is Roman Antiquity?" *The Unz Review* (2018). Available at: https://www.unz.com/article/how-fake-is-roman-antiquity/
    
    I subscribe to the theory that the "first Rome" was based in Anatolia. The Latin language likely derives from the Dacian language spoken by Thracians and Phrygians from modern Romania. The term "Byzantine" is a modern invention—the area was once called "Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn" (Kingdom of the Romans), and its inhabitants called themselves Rhōmaîoi (Romans), hailing from Romania (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most "new History" accepted today was created by Church Fathers, Jesuits (including all non-European history), and Poggio Bracciolini .
    
    Sir Isaac Newton, in *The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended* (1728), claimed 711 years were added to our calendar, with history retrofitted to the Bible. Anatoly Fomenko increased this to 1000 years, arguing all chronology rests on Joseph Scaliger (Scaligerian Chronology), who is credited with rediscovering 80% of ancient authors and literature, often on demand.
    
    Fomenko makes other controversial claims: that Plato and Gemistus Plethon were the same person; Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun were the same person; the Black Death and Justinian Plague were the same event; the Trojan War and Crusades were the same conflict; and that there were multiple "Romes," with the major one in Anatolia (modern Istanbul). I independently confirmed Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, with all early Christianity tracing back to the Bosphorus.

[^14]: Julius Caesar was a title (Caesar is etymologically similar to the Indo-Aryan word for "king," and Julius/Iulius is similar to both Jupiter and the Indo-Aryan word for "sun"). He was deified in two religions: the Flamen Dialis cult (making him the claimed son of Jupiter) and the Divus Iulius cult (posthumous deification). He had a claimed divine birth, was put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was pontifex maximus (high priest).
    
    A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47–17 BCE) refers to Asander/Asandros as "Asandros Philoromaios Soter" and gives him the title "King of Kings"—making him a "Soter"/Christ. Source: Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani (CIRB 30). Available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333149205_CIRB_30_Asandros_and_Dynamis_CIRB_Corpus_Inscriptionum_Regni_Bospori

[^15]: In many languages, "As" designates supreme deities: in Messapic and Oscan, Asa means god or divine; in Norse mythology, the Aesir (Asas) are principal gods (Odin, Thor, Freyja); in Persian mythology, "As" is associated with Mithras and Ahura Mazda; in Egyptian mythology, Ash/As is a minor sun deity; in Greek mythology, Atlas is sometimes "As"/"Aas" (related to "axios," meaning worthy/divine); "Asa" means "lord" in Thracian; Asus/Esus is a Celtic deity; in Hindu mythology, Asuras are powerful beings; in Slavic mythology, Perun is referred to as "As"/"Asa" (related to "asen," meaning noble/divine); in Etruscan, "Aesar" means god or divine. "As" is at the root of Caesar.

    Dynamis carried the title Ouriana, referring to Aphrodite Urania ("heavenly Aphrodite"). Cleopatra also depicted herself as Aphrodite, and her daughter Cleopatra Selene II was Queen Thea Muse Ourania.
    
    Another Dynamis coin depicts a Star and Crescent, also the symbol of the royal house of Adiabene and later Islam. Available at: https://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/coins/1/1864
    
    In Greek mythology, Selene (moon) is the moon goddess; her symbol is the crescent. Cleopatra Selene II's coins also depict a star and crescent.
    
    Julius Caesar used the star and crescent symbol. Available at: https://www.accla.org/actaaccla/juliuscaesar.html and https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/lots/view/3-US7SY/julius-caesar-ar-denarius-392-gms-rome-mint-l-aemilius-buca-moneyer-lifetime-issue-44-bc-ngc-au-strike-45-surface-45-e
    
    Juba II (son of Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony) also used the symbol. Available at: https://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/den_of_antiquity/48/product/mauretania_juba_ii_ar_denarius/1952816/Default.aspx

[^17]: His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod, possibly Mithridates Chrestus descendant) after Rome's defeat of Parthia around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate Parthians. Mithras is inspired by Zoroastrianism but is the same as Sabazios—a solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant carried the title Monobazus, aka Manu-Sabazios).
    
    Mithraism shares similarities with Christianity: Mithras was born of a virgin, celebrated December 25, and was a savior/redeemer. These traits are common to saviors in ancient religions, likely because they originated from the "Alexandrian School" in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism, Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and other religions came from the Alexandrian School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint.

[^21]: Jesus ben Fabus was Isa Amen (Jesus Amen) of Revelation 3:14, also Amyntas (Amen[tas]) of Galatia, also Amyntas Nikator. The name Fabus may be distorted from Jesus ben Bagus (Amyntas was son of Bogitarus; in Persian, "Bagus" means god; "Boga" in Persian/Celtic also means god; in Latin, Nikator translates to Invictus). His palace at Isauria reveals his name as Iśa. See: Ranajit Pal, *Jesus Christ Was Amyntas of Galatia* (2010).

[^22]: The name Herod likely derives from Horus and Hercules (Herakles). Mark Antony claimed descent from Hercules and declared himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became king of Judea around Mark Antony's "suicide"—typical of elites killing off one character and assuming another.
    
    The Shekel of Tyre minted by Herod depicts Mark Antony and Hercules. Available at: https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels
    
    Herod built temples to Hercules in Beirut and Tyre, and depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. Herod's son Herod Antipas shares the name of Mark Antony's son Antyllus; Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius (Mark Antony's son with Fulvia). Iullus Antonius married Marcella (daughter of Octavian's sister Octavia). Mark Antony and Fulvia had two daughters: Antonia I and II. Caligula and Claudius descended from Antonia I, who may have been Herod's sister Salome. There may be a connection between Salome's husband "Costabar" and the Roman "Ahenobarbus" who married Antonia I.
    
    Mark Antony (King Herod) = Tiberius Claudius Nero. This connection is made through the equivalence of Doris (Herod's first wife) and Livia Drusilla (Augustus's second wife). Augustus first married Scribonia (mother of Julia) but divorced her in 39 BC to marry Livia Drusilla, who was pregnant by her first husband Tiberius Claudius Nero. Their son was Emperor Tiberius.

[^23]: Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel (aka Jesus ben Sapphias) was also King Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene, aka Yeshua Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus, aka Ptolemy, aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. See: Ralph Ellis, *Jesus, King of Edessa* (2012).
    
    King Izates Monobazus married the sister of Dynamis's mother.
    
    Cleopatros in Hebrew is QLPTRS, shortened on inscriptions to QTRS or Katros, later mistakenly recorded as Cantheras. Jews derogatorily called it Panthera, i.e., Jesus Panthera.
