**Epigraph**  

*And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died ... And the Lord said unto Moses, make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.* -
Numbers 21:9 (The "serpents" in this passage are identified as Scythians in later analysis.)

**Introduction**
 
Christianity is a derivative of one of the religions that were invented at the Alexandrian School in Egypt. The Alexandrian School was a religion-making factory that was set up by Ptolemy Soter. The Serapis cult, Judaism, Gnosticism, Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and many other religions originated from there. 

All these religions were created to target regional populations in the empire and were designed to subvert their regional religions in a syncretic manner, aiming to lead the population toward monotheism and gradually toward a universal imperial cult. These religions were also likely designed to segmentat the populations by class, culture, and region to prevent a unified resistance (Mithraism was for military elites (required blood oaths. Mithraic initiates/caste system/hierarchical). Serapism was for civilians (promised afterlife salvation). Christianity was for slaves ("turn the other cheek")).

In these religions they used symbolic figures, allegories, and pseudohistorical events rather than directly deifying themselves with their own names because if they deified themselves it would have exposed their identity and centralized power too visibly, risking rebellion. Religions were psychological and political tools. The goal was to subvert regional religions, create centralized texts and priesthoods, and embed moral codes like submission, self-sacrifice, obedience, loyalty, divine judgement.

Christianity likely arose as a synthesis of the Serapis Cult, rebranded to serve one of the later Roman (Bosphoran) imperial cults which was later subverted by a group of Rabbis who were headed by a rabbi named Akiva sometime after the Bar Kokhba revolt. Jesus in the bible was a cipher, or an avatar, originally for members of the Bosphoran royal family. Asander, king of Bosphorus (Julius Caesars real identity) took on this role, so did his son Aspurgus, king of Bosphorus aka Amyntas ("Amon-Tas". "Hidden
Lord", linking to Amun-Ra - with "Amen"(tas) at the root) Nikator aka
Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen (Jesus was named
"Amen" in Rev. iii. 14) aka Caesarion, and his later descendants Izates II, king of Adiabene ("Iza" = Avestan root for "serpent" (cognate with Scythian Aži) + "-tes" = "given by," as in Mithradates = "Given by Mithra". This is cognate with the Scythian (and broader Iranian) mythological figure Aži Dahāka (Avestan) or Azhi Dahak (Middle Persian)), and Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, also took on the role. After Rabbi Akiva Jesus then became Simon Bar Kokhba.

It was a necessary for these rabbis to cut and paste from an imperial cult, just as it was necessary for the Alexandrian School religions to be packaged as sects of local religions, because getting people to abandon their religions for a new one is an impossible task. However, there are thousands of sects of major religions today, many with different prophets.

This book traces Christianity all the way back to its foundations — from the mythemes of Scythian snake-worshiping cults, to the Alexandrian School in Egypt and the Sarapis cult, to the Roman (Bosphoran) imperial cult — and then finishes with the subversion of the Bosphoran cult.

A few things that you need to know before you read my book:

-Much of what we know of ancient history is fabricated by the Jesuits and Vatican. The
Egyptian-Persian-Indian-Greek-Roman elite were Sarmatian/Saka warlords
who ruled through proxy dynasties. Egypt, Persia, India, Greece, Rome,
etc., were all under the suzerainty of Aryan Iranian-Scythian elites
since at least the 17th century BC and their base of operation was on the Bosphorus river.

-Western Rome in Italy is a phantom empire that was invented by the Vatican. Western Rome was built during the Renaissance period. The original Rome (in Sarmatian, "Ruma" (Rome) = "Place of the Dragon" (Rhu-Ma, from Aži Dahāka, the Iranian dragon)) was located on the Bosphorus.
    
-Asander, king of Bosphorus aka Julius Caesar was also Ptolemy XI Alexander II, Cleopatra's uncle, but he took on numerous
other regional aliases. Cleopatra was also Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus. Mark
Antony the Neos-Dionysos was either Ptolemy of Cyprus, a brother of
Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII Auletes (Auletes name adapts well to the
Parthian Orodes (II?)) the Neos Dionysos aka Polemon (Polemos ->
Ptolemy) I of Pontus aka Pharnaces II ("Pharao-Nikes", or "Victorious Pharaoh") aka King Herod (Egyptian: Heru (Horus) + Ud
(divine) -> Herud -> "Herod") aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates
IV of Parthia (Per-aa or Per-Nesu is a corruption of Pharaoh), or he was
Ptolemy XII Auletes himself (Cleopatra's full name, Cleopatra VII
Philopator, derives from the Ancient Greek 'Φιλοπάτωρ' meaning "the one
who loves her father", or simply "father-loving"). She was also married
to two of her brothers and her uncle as listed previously. This is how
incestuous this family was.

This book directly challenges mainstream historiography. My methodologies are:
archaeological and numismatic evidence, linguistic and etymological
analysis, and historical correlation and timeline analysis. The sources
that inspired my work are listed in the 'Bibliography' section at the
end of the book.

**1 Name and Title Meanings**

-   Azhi: Azhi = Až ("serpent") + Hi ("power, divine") in Avestan, meaning "mighty dragon". It extends Aži to signify divine authority across Indo-Iranian and Scythian cultures. Azhi = Asia (Azhi-A) = "land of the mighty dragon" (Aži is cognate with the Chinese Zhī (dragon)), a very similar name as Rome (Rhu-Ma) = "Place of the Dragon", Romania (Rhu-Ma + Na) = "dragon land", and Sarmatia (serpent) + ma (mother, land). 
-   Caesar: The Egyptian name "Asar" was another name for Osiris. "Ra"
    was the Egyptian deity of the Sun (Asar-Ra). Sar means king in Scythain. This title very likely
    connects to "Asar-Hapi" (Osiris-Apis), another name for the
    Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis (Osiris + Apis = Osorapis). The Etruscan
    word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar"), meaning god or
    divine, likely derives from the Egyptian Asar. The Greek language
    adds a "K" to foreign words, so Aesar -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin
    Caesar. This title also resembles the the Scythian/Hurrian "Kur-Sar" (Sun King), the Phoenician "Kosar" (sun god), Assyrian "Aššur" (god) Scythian "As" (lord) and Scythian Sar (king), Kšar (from the Old Persian Xšaya = king) and also Cyrus the Great's title (Kuruš (Cyrus) = Khur (Sun) + -uš (lord)).
-   Christ: Kur-Ist (Scythian: Kur, "mountain serpent" + Ist, "being/existence"). This ties to Sumerian "Kur" (mountain/dragon), Vedic "Kṛṣṇa" = "Dark Serpent" (from Kṛṣṇa =
    "black," linked to Ananta-Shesha, the cosmic serpent), Avestan Kavi-Rist (Kavi, king-priest + Rist, order/truth) and Greek Kurios =   "Lord". Christ
    is identical to the title Soter. Several historical figures were
    Christs/Soters. In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus the Great "The
    Anointed One". Alexander the Great was also a Chréstos/Soter
    (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b). Up until the First
    Council of Nicaea the title "Christ", or "Christian", refered to the
    Serapis Cult ("those who worship Serapis are, in fact, Christians,
    and those who call themselves bishops of Christ are, in fact,
    devotees of Serapis.". Source: The Letter of Hadrian to Servianus).
-   Cotys: In Thracian, "Cotys" is related to the word "kotys", a title
    meaning "lord". In the Celtic languages the word "cottos" or
    "cottius" means "chieftain".
-   Izates or Izas: "Iza" (𐬌𐬰𐬀) = Avestan root for "serpent" (cognate with Scythian Aži). "-tes" = Greek suffix, but possibly from dāta ("given by," as in Mithradates = "Given by Mithra"). This is cognate with the Scythian (and broader Iranian) mythological figure Aži Dahāka (Avestan) or Azhi Dahak (Middle Persian), a monstrous serpent or dragon.
 -   Jew: Iudii (Celtic tribe) + Aži (serpent). The Iudii, a Galatian tribe, were Sarmatian priests whose religious practices were rooted in Druidism who later became "Jews" under Alexandrian syncretism. The term "Ashkenazi" (Scythian: Ashkuza) confirms their steppe origins, demonized by Rabbi Akiva to erase their Sarmatian roots. 
-   Jesus: Likely a phonetic shift from Asar/Aesus (pronounced
    ah-soos). Another option: "Yeshua" = "Yazata" (Divine Serpent-Lord), related to Izates (Yazata).
  - Lord: The term Kavi in Avestan texts (e.g., Yasna 10.6) denotes a divine ruler associated with Aži (dragon/serpent). Translating Kavi to Greek yields Kyrios ("lord"), a title used for Jesus in the New Testament (e.g., Kyrios Iesous). The Scythian title Xšaya (king) appears in Old Persian as Xšayathiya, phonetically linked to Kshatriya (Sanskrit: warrior-king) and Caesar via the Greek Kaesar. A kurgan inscription from Issyk (Kazakhstan, 4th century BCE) mentions a ruler named Ašakavi ("dragon-priest"), combining Aša (truth/order) and Kavi. This title parallels Asander (Thracian: Asa = "lord") and suggests a pan-steppe naming convention for dragon-kings. 
-   Monobazus: Sabazios is the Phrygian and Thracian version of Zeus.
    Ma'nu is likely a diminutive of Menneus ("son of man"), and then
    Manu-Sabazios becomes Monobazus. Monobazus also becomes "Bazus" or
    "Bar Izates" shortened to "baYZTus" (or bar YZT) through frequent
    oral repetition which then becomes "bOETHus". The Boethusians were a
    jewish priestly sect.
-   Piso cognomen: "Appius" is a cognomen (personal name) of the
    Claudian family. Appius and Piso are synonymous (In Greek, Appius is
    rendered as Appios, from there Piso). The name Piso itself would be
    a form of Peisistratos/Pisistratos, the leading name of ancient
    Athens in Greece. (Pisistratos is a Latinized spelling of the Greek
    Peisistratos). It could be said that all the ruling elite of the
    Julio-Claudian dynasty were Pisos, including Nero who was nearly
    deposed by a Piso. Appius is also cognate with Arrius (through
    rhotacization in ancient Latin the /p/ and /r/ could be swapped.
-   Sar root:  Sar is the Scythian word for "king". Sarpa in Sanskrit means "serpent". Sarmatian, Akkadian Sarrum (king), Hurrian Šarri, Sargon, Sarlagab, Serapis (Sar-Apis = "Serpent Bull"), Zarathustra (Sar + Ustra = "serpent-lord"), Saracen (Roman designation for Middle Eastern peoples), Caesar, Asar (Osiris), Tsar (Slavic monarch), etc. Sar means king, or serpent king, across the empires that the Scythians used to rule over.

**2 Ancient Alias Names List (Chronologically Organized by Era and Dynasty)**

Note on aliases: I believe that the Ptolemaic elites in antiquity employed an incredible number of regional aliases, locations, fictional stories, faked adoptions, and fabricated deaths for themselves and their family members as a way to control the
population. They role-played as deities, religious figures, and various characters as if they were actors in a play. For example, the governor of Roman Egypt from 33 CE to 38, Aulus Avillius Flaccus, was also Polemon II of Pontus, who was
the prince of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, which was
the regional alias of Emperor Titus. The character of Aulus Avillius
Flaccus dies at the same time Polemon II of Pontus takes power, and then
Polemon II of Pontus dies around the same time Titus becomes emperor.
The way to connect them is through the fact that they were all married
to the same woman, Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod. Also note that all these kings/emperors had philosopher or religious figure aliasas, probably derived Summeria who required kings to also be priests or from Plato's "Philospher Kings" concept (Asander of Bosphours aka Julius Caesar was Gaius Julius Sohaemus the Priest-King of Emesa, Tiberius Julius Alexander was Josephus, Juba II was Apollonius of Tyana, King Izates was Jesus Ben Gamala, Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania was Philo of Alexndria, etc.).

I. Ptolemaic & Bosphoran Dynasty 

-   Julius Caesar: Ptolemy XI Alexander
II, Asander, King of Bosphorus (Philocaesar Philoromaios, Soter, Great
King of Kings, "As" in his name refers to
Asar(Osiris)/Aesar/Aeser/Aisar/Ais/Is), Brogitarix. Other suspected aliases: Akrosandros II, King of Scythia, Idumean Antipater, Parthian Artavasdes (Greek Alex = Persian
    Arta) who was the brother of Tigranes II (Tigranes II/the Great was called Azhdahak proving Aži Dahāka was a royal Scythian title), and the Hasmonean
    Alexander II (son of king Aristobulus II son of Jannaeus Alexander
    also the nephew and son-in-law of king/high-priest Hyrcanus II.
    Also, Julius = Janneus? Or Janneus (Yannai) is related to the Roman
    name Gaius?)
-   Cleopatra VII (Isis who in mythology was the wife of Osiris and the
mother of Horus): Dynamis Ourania (Aphrodite Urania), Pythodorida
Philometor
-   Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius = Mar (Phoenician "lord") +
Anton (from Antaeus, giant son of Gaia)): King Herod, Tiberius Claudius
Nero, Phraates IV, Polemon I.

II. Herodian & Flavian Dynasty

-   Alexander (son of Herod): Juba II.
-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod): (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
    (Alexander) bar Menneus, Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka Joseph Panthera,
    the name for jesus's father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption
    of Cantheras, or Cleopatros. Also, Panthera = Ptolemy in Hebrew),
    Tiberius Julius Alexander Major, Alexander the Alabarch.
-   Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania: Cleopatra IX, Helene,
    Drusilla of Mauretania, Julia Ourania of Parthia, Philo of
    Alexandria. She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary "Pallas", and
    "Antonia Caenis" who was Vespasian's first cousin and mistress.
-   Simon Boethus: Simon Magus, Ptolemy X Alexander I
-   Tiberius Julius Alexander: Emperor Nerva, Arrius Piso, Josephus
-   Marcus Julius Alexander: Izates Monobazus ("Jesus Emmanuel"), Yeshua
    Cleopatros

III. Flavian Emperors

-   Vespasian: Herod Agrippa I (See: The Royal Ancestry of Emperor
    Vespasian. Henry Davis,
    https://www.henryhdavis.com/theroyalancestryofemperorvespasian
    [[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)]),
    Flavius Scaevinus
-   Titus: Polemon II, Aulus Avillius Flaccus

IV. Speculative

-   Alexander the Great: Scythian prince who was the son of Ateas the Scythian aka Artaxerxes
    II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") and half-brother of Darius III ("Darab").
    In India he took the regional aliases of Chandragupta Maurya
    ("Chandragupta" = "Sander-Gupta" (Scythian "Sander" = Alexander. "Aleks" = Greekization of "Alakh" which means "not seen" or "unseen" in Sanskrit/Hindi. "Gupta" = Hidden)). "Aži-ander": Aži
    (Avestan "dragon") + Andros (Greek "man") = "Dragon-Man". Alaksandu
    of Wilusa, a Hittie king of Wilusa (Troy) (Alaksandu = Alak-San-Du
    (Hurrian: "Ruler-Dragon-Son")), who predates Alexander by 800 years,
    proves that the name Alexander was a Scythian title for kings.
    Aži-Sandar also = "Dragon King" in Mittani and Old Persian.
    Alexander's mother Olympias (Ol or ophis + Pias = "serpent queen"), who was a Scythian princess of the
    Molossian tribe, claimed to have been impregnanted by the god Zeus
    Ammon disguised as a dragon. Alexander also married the Scythian princess Roxana.
-   Gautama Buddha (Egyptian: "Ba-Djehuti", or "Soul of Thoth"): Gaumata
    Bardya (Cyrus the Great's son)
-   Marcion of Sinope: Markianos of Alexandria, The association with Sinope came from Aquila of Sinope who was a disciple of Rabbi Akiva. Are the two the same? Probably.
-    Moses = Manes/Mannu-Kuras = Manu (Scythian Sage-King) = Menes (Egypt’s legend-founder). Also appears in "Monobazus" → “Manu Bazus” → Sarmatian-Mythological Sage King. The Iranian Manu is a legendary civilizer, and in India he becomes the first Lawgiver (the Manu Smriti = Scythian governance code). The biblical Moses defeats Pharaoh (actually Mitanni elite), parts waters with a serpent-staff—obvious encoding of dragon-kingship (Aži Dahāka). Moses takes on different masks: M enes – the first official Pharaoh (not real, a compilation of conquerors). Menes – the semi-mythical Median king, founder of the priest-class. Mannu-kuras – Proto-Mede, whose name becomes Cyrus. The name Kur-Ash = "Sun Man". The Exodus is not Judaic memory: it's a political memory of Mitanni-Scythian expulsion from Egypt after the religious revolution of Thutmose III → Horemheb wiped them out with a new priest-kingship in Amarna.
 -   Paul the Apostle = likely a composite character or an avatar/cipher. Two suspects for having taking on the character are: 1) Saulus ben Antipater who was the
    son of Antipater/Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, grandson of King Herod
    (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Chapter 9, section 211), and 2) Rabbi Akiva (whose students included: Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter (Shimon bar Yonah)). The character
    Paul/Saul's life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story
    "Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor". Josephus in Antiquities of the
    Jews, Book XX (CH 9.4) refers to Paul (Saulus) as related to Herod
    Agrippa.    -
 -   Pythagoras: Abaris the Hyperborean. The high priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi was called Pythia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia)\] who breathed serpent vapors (ethylene gas). Greek writers regarded the Hyperboreans as the mythical founders of Apollo's shrines at Delos and Delphi  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea#Hyperboreans_in_Delos \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea#Hyperboreans_in_Delos)\]. The name "Pythagoras" is derived from the Greek words "Pythios" (Πύθιος), meaning "of Pythia" or "belonging to the Pythia ("Pythoness"). Abaris was a Scythian and the Scythians worshiped snake deities. Pythia was probably Pythagoras' mother.

**3 The Sarmatian Dragon Cult**

The Hyperboreans were a real Bronze Age civilization in the Ural-Volga region of modern Russia who spread their culture southward via the Kurgan hypothesis (c. 4000 BCE). Their descendants, the Scythians, then spread their Draco (dragon/serpent) cult across Eurasia, encoded in snake worshiping myths. The domestication
of the horse and invention of the chariot allowed them to travel vast
distances. They were a priesthood of dragon/serpent-worshipping kings
[^1]

The Scythian tribe called the Sarmatians (also called Sauromatians
("Saur" = "Lizard/Dragon" + "Matae" = "Men/Warriors" - where the
Sumerian "sar" (king) comes from) were a nomadic Indo-Iranian warrior
elite from the Pontic steppe (modern Ukraine/Russia). 

All ancient Mediterranean religions derive from the
repackaging of Sythian serpent-dragon worshiping religions. See: Papaios and the Snake-Legged Goddess (Scythian) = Nehebkau, Uraeus, and Apep/Apophis (Egypt) = Ningishzida (Sumerian) = Tiamat and Mušḫuššu who was associated with Marduk (Babylonian) = Aži Dahāka (Zoroastrianism) later syncretized with Mithra = Ophion, Agathodaemon, Typhon, and Delphi's Pythoness priestess (Greek) = Nāgendra and Nāga (Vedic), Nehushtan/serpent staff of Moses, the Dacian and Roman Draco standards, the serpent-worshipping Essenes and Gnostics, Sebazi (Phrygian/Bulgarian), Jörmungandr (Norse), Ouroboros serpent in Freemasony, etc. The Knights Templar knew the truth. The Templars worshipped Baphomet—a Sarmatian dragon deity (Aži Dahāka).

Kings who took on the snake/dragan/serpent/Azhi Dahaka title: Scorpion I, Pharaoh of Egypt, Azhdahak, which is the Armenian form of the name of the Avestan Azhi Dahaka, was associated with the Median king Astyages (564–550 BC) who was the grandfather of Cyrus the Great. Tigranes II/the Great, King of Armenia (140–55 BC) was also called Azhdahak. Izates II, king of Adiabene's title Iza" = Avestan root for "serpent" (cognate with Scythian Aži), Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus ('Saur'
means 'lizard' or 'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'). The roots of the snake titles were: Aži-, Azhd-, -zates, Sauro-, Draco-.

The snake was revered by the Scythians for several reasons: apart from symbolism, the Sarmatians used armor that resembled snake skin, the Scythian priesthood called the Agaroi created poisons called "scythicon" from snake venom that they used on their arrows, and snake venom was used as pain killers and stimulants before war. Snake venom was also used to stop battlefield wounds from bleeding, as well as, they were used as anecdotes, as later emulated by figures such as Mithridates of Pontus who daily consumed a potion called "Mithridatium" which was claimed to make people invincible. Also, the foundation myth of the Scythians is that they were created from the Snake-Legged Goddess who was impregnated by Hercules (Targiatos).

Timeline:

-Gutian Dynasty (2150 BC) – First Scythian rulers of Mesopotamia.\
-The Hyksos (1650–1550 BC) – Scythian Pharaohs of Egypt (Heka-Khasut means "Rulers of Foreign Lands" and Khasut is a cognate of Scythian/Saka, Scyth, Scoloti).\
-The Hittites (1600–1200 BC) – Scythians in Anatolia.\
-Kassite Dynasty (1595–1155 BCE) - Scythian rulers of Babylon after Hittites sacked it.\
-The Mitanni (1500 BC) – Scythian horse lords in Syria.\
-Vedic India (1500 BC) – Scythian chariot kings.\
-"Sea Peoples" collapse Mediterranean empires (Scythian mercenaries) (1200 BC) \
-The "Dorian Greeks" who destroyed Mycenae (c. 1200 BC) were steppe nomads and Scythian-Sarmatians.\
-Persia’s Achaemenids (705–330 BC) - Saka (Scythian) clan.\
-The Etruscan Tarquin dynasty (616 BC) - Scythian rulers of Rome. Tarquin = Tarkhu (Scythian: "Ruler"). Servius Tullius = Tulli (Scythian: "Wolf Clan").

The Mitanni exercised hegemony over a pan-Eurasian empire. The Hittites,
also known as the Neshians, were one enforcement arm for the Mitanni.
They ruled by military dominance (chariots, cavalry, mercenaries),
installing puppet kings (often their own bloodline), controlling trade
routes (Silk Road, Black Sea, Pontic Steppe), and through enforcing
religious syncretism.

The eruption of Thera (Santorini) around 1600 BCE triggered a volcanic
winter that was recorded all the way in China. This destroyed the
ancient economy and caused continual strife and this was one of the
causes of the eventual collapse of the Bronze Age and the fragmentation
of Scythian hegemony. It also led to the Hyksos expulsion from Egypt and
Assyria rising up under the Chaldean priests (the Kalani, the Jews).
Jews refered to them as Ashkenaz, meaning Scythian (Josephus. Vol. 5:
Antiquities: 8:2:5, pp. 593-595). Khazaria is the former territory of
the Scythians, which is why they they were called Ashkenazi.

The Sea Peoples were the revenge against Babylon, Hittites, and Egypt
after the Mitanni were exiled.

The Hyksos descendants then re-emerged in Persia and Anatolia, later
reclaiming Egypt under the Achaemenid Period (525 BCE).

![Fig.1.1](/images/SauromatesII.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.1 Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. Does he look
familiar? ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ in the above coin translates to "King of
the Sauromatians". Sauromates is a Greek rendering of 'Sarmatian',
referring to the Scythian tribe who came from the Pontic steppe. 'Saur'
means 'lizard' or 'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'.
Therefore, translated literallly ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ means "King of the
lizard people", or "king of the dragon people".

![Fig.1.2](/images/Tamga.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.2 The royal Tamga (symbol/signature) of Tiberius Julius Sauromates II contains a cross and a Chi Rho.

Ramesses II = "Ra-Mesu" (Scythian for "Born of the Sun Stallion"). "Ra"
= Egyptian sun god (syncretized with Scythian Mithra). "Mesu" = "Mares"
(horse in Scythian, symbol of kingship). Full meaning: "Sun Stallion's
Son".

Cyrus the Great = "Kurush" (Scythian for "Sun King"). The name "Cyrus"
(Old Persian: Kuruš) derives from Scythian "Khur" (Sun) + "Us" (Lord) =
"Sun Lord" (identical to Mitra/Mithra, the Indo-Iranian sun god). In
Avestan (Scythian religious texts), "Kavi" means "King-Priest". Cyrus'
clan was the "Kayanian" dynasty (Scythian royal bloodline).

Darius I = "Dārayavahuš" which was Scythian for "Holding the Horse" (a
Scythian warlord title). Darius' father was Hystaspes (Vištāspa)---which
means "Horse Tamer" in Scythian.

Xerxes = "Xšaya-ṛšā" (Scythian for "Hero-King"). "Xšaya" = "Kshatriya"
(warrior caste in Indo-Aryan). "Ṛšā" = "Aršan" (hero, male ruler in
Scythian). Full meaning: "Warrior-Hero King".

Sargon of Akkad = "Sharru-Kin" (Scythian for "True King of the Bow").
"Sharru" = "Xšaya" (king in Scythian, same as Xerxes). "Kin" = "Kaman"
(bow in Scythian, referring to horse archers). Full meaning: "King of
the Bowmen."

The Ptolemaic Egyptians (Ptolemaios - the root "ptol" resembling the
Indo-Iranian term for warrior-kings (e.g., Parthian pat, "lord"), or
Scythian Patala (horse lords), were the continuation of this bloodline.

The "Chi-Rho" (☧) symbol of Constantine was not Christian---it was the
Sarmatian Draco coiled around a solar cross.

In Sarmatian, "Ruma" (Rome) = "Place of the Dragon" (Rhu-Ma, from Aži
Dahāka, the Iranian dragon).

Footnotes (Chapter 3)

(a) The eruption of Thera (Santorini) was one factor in destroying the
    Scythian steppe warriors hegemony, but the biggest cause was a
    cannabis cult that stripped them of their martial spirit

    fearless warriors into potheads who were led by transgender priests.
(b) Azhdahak, which is the Armenian form of the name of the Avestan Azhi Dahaka, was associated with the Median king Astyages (r. 564–550 BC) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azhdahak_(mythology)   
(c) Quetzalcōātl, the Mesoamerican serpent deity, shares uncanny similarities to Aži Dahāka which suggests a transoceanic exchange of religious ideas long before Columbus (the Jade Mask of Calakmul (7th century CE) depicts a Caucasian-featured ruler with a serpent headdress—resembling Scythian dragon crowns).

**4 The Alexandrian School**

In Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter, who was a Scythian continuation of the Sarmatian snake/serpent kings line, used religion to subjugate the vast and disparate peoples he ruled. This was likely inspired by Plato's noble lie which is a concept from his work "The Republic" where he suggests that a myth or falsehood can be used by rulers to maintain social order and promote the common good. The Alexandrian School then became his religion making factory. He was in the process of creating a universal religion and this was being achieved by gradual syncretism using local identities and blending local deities into syncretic universal savior archetypes (Interpretatio Graecae) as a transitional phase toward a universal monotheism. The Ptolemaic elites were conditioning the disparate populations they ruled into accepting the Serapis cult (sarp- is a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "serpent" as seen in Sanskrit sarpa, "snake". "Sar-Ap" translates to "Serpent-Lord" in Scythian. (*One other option is that these religions were targeted towards different castes: Mithraism was for military elites (required blood oaths. Mithraic initiates/caste system/hierarchical). Serapism was for civilians (promised afterlife salvation). Christianity was for slaves ("turn the other cheek")).

Fig. 1.3 Copper statuette of the god Sarapis Amun Agathodaemon depicted as half-deity. half-snake (Egypt late Hellenistic/early Roman period 1st century BC - 1st century AD).

The Sarapis cult eventually evolved into Christianity, which was repackaged Serapis cult and targeted at local populations (the Christogram symbolizing Jesus Christ (IHS) = "Isis-Horus-Serapis"). Religion was the technology that the empire used to subjugate the people they ruled.

4.1 Judaism 

Ptolemy I Soter was also responsible for inventing Judaism. His aim was to subvert Canaanite identity once and for all, destroying the only contestant to Greco-Egyptian power in the world up to that point, and gradually forcing jews to accept the Serapis cult. 

It was in Alexandria at the Library of Alexandria where the Pentateuch and Septuagint were written. The myth of the jewish people and the Laws of Moses were based on Plato's hypothetical colony of Magnesia from his thesis called The Laws (347 BC) in which the proposed charter for the Cretan colony of Magnesia was modeled in large part on Athenian legal and constitutional traditions. Ancestor received law from a deity, hereditary priesthood rather than king, as well as the division into 12 tribes were all part of the formula. Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) is where the story of Abraham comes from. Plato's Timaeus is also the source for Genesis 1-11 15. Homer's Odysseey was the source of Genesis 24, 42-46. The biblical concept of hell was stolen from Plato's Replublic ('Myth of Er'), and the spiritual plane of Heaven is ripped off from Plato's 'World of Forms'. Exodus is just a semitized retcon of Jason and the Argonauts, and the Oracles Against the Nations plagiarize the Sibylline Oracles.

Moses = Osarseph (Osar (Osiris) and seph (son) = Son of Osirus). The Greek rendering of Moses and Osarseph are identical. Osarseph appears in accounts by the Egyptian priest Manetho, who described him as a renegade priest leading a group of lepers in rebellion, eventually adopting the name "Moses" (Josephus. 'Against Apion' discussing Manetho's account of Osarseph). Osarseph also = Serapis. The "Ser" symbol in Ser-apis is the same as seph meaning "son of". Serapis can be interpreted as "Son of Osiris-Apis", which evolved into "Son of Osiris". So, Serapis is just another word for Osarseph. Solomon = Sol-Amūn ("Sun of Amun"). Abraham (Brahmin > Ibrahim > Abraham. A(Braha)m(in)) = Ab-Ram, or Son of Ram. Alexander was the Ram god (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_of_Alexander), he was also Chandragupta Maurya in India.

The original redhead clan of Druids that ended up becoming Israelites were Celtic Scythians who migrated southwards during the early Aryan invasion of 4000 BC. Scythian --> Saka --> Isaac. This migration coincides with the development of early bronze age civilization. They went to Anatolia first (Galatia), then Babylon, then Canaan ('Gaulinitis' = Golan Heights). In Canaan, the natives then came under the suzerainty of these Celts and their entire identity, language, and religion derives from this. The evidence for this is paternal DNA assays (Galatian Celts carried the Celtic R1b haploytpe (10% of Ashkenazi jews), but also R1a, G2a, J2a, which are other paternal lineages that make up the bulk of jews paternal haplotypes), the fact that the Celtic languages are surprisingly Semitic with a verb-subject-object word order and a shocking amount of vocabulary overlap, and the name of Irish deities, Balor and his holiday Beltaine are cognate to Bal and Elatha the Irish Uranus is cognate to Hebrew El. King David (DWD) = King Druid. 1 Samuel 16:12 claims that King David had red hair. As for the name 'jew', the descriptive name Judaism was never used by the Hebrews or Israelites; it appears only with Christianity. It comes from Yahud or Auda which comes from Iodh or Ioux. Iodh and Ioux are associated with the yew tree in Druidism and is sometimes linked to the concept of rebirth and regeneration. The ancient Celtic prefixes 'Rab' or 'Rhab' mean 'wise one' or 'seer', and a Druid equates to a Rabbi.

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts who called themselves Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who was Pythagoras's teacher, who was the son of Seuthes (Seth), shows this. The term Abaris was inspired by the Semitic Iber. Iber was sometimes rendered as Aber or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew languages. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for Ireland. The word Atlantis means ‘The Island of Atlas’. The titan Atlas was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the  bearer of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia, the Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas where the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.). Dionysius of Alexandria in Egypt (ca. 190-264 CE) also referred to the inhabitants of Britain as Iberi.

'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the ancient Akkadians. The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri, known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks. Cimmerians were a middle eastern offshoot of the Celtic Cimbri tribe. 

These Celtic males mixed with Neolithic Anatolian woman before their descendants moved into Egypt (Apiru or Habiru) and Caanan and then mixed with indigenous people in those places. Celtic Jews (Iudii) then dissapeared after the Bar Kokhba Revolt when emperor Hadrian decimated their popuation. Modern Ashkenazi Jews are a hodgepodge of Neolithic (proto-Sicilian who originated in Anatolia), native Canaanites (who were literal human-neanderthal hybrids [^2]), proto-Arab Natufians (Natufians had ~20% higher Basal Eurasian -- Basal means with SSA, North Africa was green/fertile so sub-saharin Africans could cross the Sahara), and Celtic Cimbri and Celtic Galatian from Anatolia.

The rest of the jewish religion and identity came from later incarnations of this imperial cult: I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the Hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus).

Abel and Cain are just a copy of Romulus and Remus. Judas Iscariot is a copy of Brutus. Genesis 4:5-31. Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah, Lamech, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, are copies of Titus Livy's Regal Rome of the seven kings.

After the Serapis cult the Alexandrian School made an industry out of taking existing religions and then adding to them a psyop slave-morality foundation. The goal was to get the population to accept monotheism and move them towards the Sarapis cult. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism, Mithraism, Christianity, Manichaeanism, Valentinianism, Hermeticism (Philo of Alexandria’s syncretic philosophy to Hellenize the Canaanite religion of the levant), Buddhism (most likely Philo of Alexandria’s syncretic attempt at combining the ancient Vedas with Stoicism/Alexandrian slave morality to subvert the Indo-Aryans, etc., all came from here. 

**5 Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus**

There was a Bosphoran [^3] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^4] took
on the role of Asander (also Asandros), King of Bosphorus [^5] ("Asa"
means "lord" in Thracian and Celtic and likely derives from the Scythian Assaioi (As-saioi = As is Scythian for "Serpent Lord", and Sai refers to clan/tribe. Sar means king in Scythian), and "andros" means "man" or "son of
man" in Greek. Jesus is referred to as "the son of man" 81 times in the
four canonical gospels. Asandros can also be interpreted as "son of the
lord" or "son of Asa, the lord". The Thracian version of Zeus was Asa,
the Celtic was Esus/Hesus (Esus becomes Aesus, pronounced ah-soos. There
was no J in ancient Latin, so Jesus was pronounced ah-soos as well). The
Etruscan word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar" which likely
derives from the Egyptian "Asar" which was another name for Osiris),
from which Asa may also derive, means "god" or "divine". Asandros can
also translate to either "son of god", or "son of Lord Aesar/Asar
(Osiris)". The Greek language often added the prefix "K" to words
borrowed from other languages, so Aesar ("god") -> Greek Kaesar ->
Latin Caesar. Cleopatra used the regional alias of Dynamis Ourania [^6]
(translating to 'heavenly power'), queen of the Bosporus. Cimmerian
Bosporus approximates to modern-day Crimea in southern Ukraine (see
also: Jesus Christ Was Born in Crimea by Anatoly Fomenko).

that is visible in the Julius Caesar coin above. The crescent moon and
star symbol has Mithraic symbolism, and another coin of Asander depicts a
Phrygian cap which is closely associated with the Roman god Mithras:

obviously many years between the ages at which she was depicted,
however, even in the elder Dynamis bust you can see her lazy eye and
abnormally large eyes which she was reported to have had, possibly as a
consequence of inbreeding. The hat she is wearing is a Phrygian cap, a
distinctivehat that is closely associated with the Roman god Mithras.
Dynamis was recorded as being of "Sarmatian" ancestry.

![Fig.1.8](/images/cleopatra.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.8. (L) Julia Mamaea, Queen of Pontus (wife of Polemon II), (R)
Cleopatra VII. Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus was a regional aliases
of Julius Caesar/Asander (as Asander and Polemon were both married to
Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She
would have been married to her half-brother (Cleopatra and Mark Antony's
son) Polemon II, King of Pontus aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka
Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of the
Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next to the Pontus Kingdom

Asander was born in 110 BCE, the same year as Julius Caesar. Dynamis was
born in 70/69 BCE, the same year as Cleopatra VII. Julius Caesar was 30
years older than Cleopatra, and Asander was also 30 years older than
Dynamis.

A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17
BCE), refers to Asander as the "Great King of Kings Asandros
Philoromaios Soter" (Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani 30). So, he
was a 'King of Kings', Soter (savior), and 'The Great'. Individually,
each of those titles carries significance, but the 'Great King of Kings'
title in that inscription stands out because it is a rare title that was
used by Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great, so this shows Asander's
level of prestige and power to be placed alongside those two. Julius
Caesar is the only historical figure who had a comparable level of
prestige as Cyrus and Alexander.

Dynamis's father was Mithridates VI Eupator who also carried the title
"King of Kings". Her uncle was Mithridates "Chrestus" [^7]. The name
Mithridates (more accurately, Mithradates) is the Hellenized form of the
Indo-Aryan Mithra-Datt, meaning "One given by Mithra". Mithra is the
Indo-Aryan sun-god and Datt ("given by") derives from the
Proto-Indo-European root da ("to give"). That name was born by a large
number of kings, soldiers and statesmen in the Iranian dynasty of the
Parthians and mostly by the royalty and nobility in Asia Minor.

Mithridates VI Eupator beat his brother Mithridates Chrestus in war to
become king of Pontus/Bosphorus. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the
city is founded as the result of a fratricide, with the twins Romulus
and Remus quarreling over who has the favor of the gods and over each
other's plans to build Rome, with Romulus becoming Rome's first king and
namesake after killing his brother (mirroring the biblical account of
Cain and Abel).

Mithridates VI, king of Pontus, was the father of both Pharnaces II and
Dynamis (Cleopatra). Pharnaces II was Ptolemy XIV who was Cleopatra's
brother-husband.

Asander beat Mithridates Chrestus (his uncle) in battle to become King
of Bosphorus. After Mithridates Chrestus's loss to Asander he was
imprisoned and executed by his elder brother, Mithridates VI Eupator,
who had previously beat him in war.

Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus aka Pharnaces II aka Ariarathes
IX (Arya-Ratha". Sanskrit:"Noble Charioteer") was also Brogitarix, king
of Galatia (Full name: Brogitaris (Brigatos) van (de) Celtes
Trocmii:"Bogo-" is related to the Proto-Celtic word "bog-", which means
"god" or "divine". "-diatarus" could be connected to the Latin word
"diatus", meaning "divine" or "godlike", the Old Irish word -tairx means
" lord"."Van" or "de" is a preposition indicating "of" or "from",
which suggests that Brogitaris/Brigatos is the divine leader or a member
of the Celtes Trocmii which refers to the Trocmi, a Celtic tribe that
lived in ancient Galatia). Brogitarix's son Amyntas ("Amon-Tas". "Hidden
Lord", linking to Amun-Ra - with "Amen"(tas) at the root) Nikator aka
Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen (Jesus was named
"Amen" in Rev. iii. 14) [^8] ruled an empire that stretched from
modern-day Turkey through India. His palace at Isauria refers to Isis
(also known as Isa or Aset) who was the mother of Horus (Cleopatra
identified herself with the Greco-Egyptian goddess Isis. So, her son
would have been Isa, son of Isis. The son of Isis in mythology was
Horus, and that is why Caesarion's iconography has a Horus falcon on
it). He was likely Caesarion.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Julius Caesar aka Asander = Tiberius
Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios (Aspurgus translates to "horseman-lord" in
Thracian languages. Sabazios was a Thracian deity worshipped as a
horseman.).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony [^9] (aka Ptolemy of
Cyprus, a brother of Ptolemy XII Auletes (Cleopatra's father) making him
Celopatra's uncle aka Polemon I of Pontus aka King Herod aka Tiberius
Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander Helios aka
Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his twin
sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal (one way to prove that Mark Antony was also King
Herod is through the equivalence of Alexander Helios aka Alexander (son
of King Herod) aka Juba II).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony = Ptolemy Philadelphus who
was Sampsiceramus I?

Mark Antony's son with Livia Drusilla = emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Augustus (one way to prove that Mark Antony was both King Herod and
Tiberius Claudius Nero is through the equivalence of Doris the first
wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
Octavius/Caesar Augustus (the Greek name Doris is a transliteration of
the Roman Drus-us). Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but was
divorced and he became engaged to Livia Drusilla (Doris), who was at the
time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband Tiberius
Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius
Nero, praetor of 62 BC).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria' (aka Julius Philo, of the Julia gens, because she was the
adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar). She was also Claudius and
Nero's secretary Pallas and Vespasian's first cousin and mistress
Antonia Caenis. "The full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas,
with the Antonius part being an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony
and that Pallas wasn't a random slave. (Philo's hebrew name was Yedidia
which means"beloved of God", or"friend of God", which is the same as
Theophilos in Greek. Around 26% of the New Testament was written to
Theophilus in Luke and Acts of the Apostles).

Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister-wife Cleopatra (Thea

an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning 'lord'. He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image

Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed
above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the 'Sons of Ptolemy'), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc., and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^11]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

Fig. 1.17. Ptolemy XII Auletes, king of Egypt, who was also Mithridates
VI Eupator, Ariarathes VII of Cappadocia, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al. Mithridates VI married his sister
Laodice---just as Ptolemy XII married his sister Cleopatra V. Both had
daughters named Cleopatra who ruled (Cleopatra VII and Dynamis).

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy XII Auletes/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesar's life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^12],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^13], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

Endnotes (Chapter 5)

(a) The throne name of Ptolemy Philometer was Ir-maat-en-amun-re. This
    would strengthen the word play between the names Philo-meter,
    Mithra-dates, and Matthath-ius. (The Egyptian Maat-en transliterates
    to the Hebrew Mattan/Mattath and the name "metor" transliterates
    into Parthian Mithra). Philometer then corresponds to Mithradates of
    Parthia and Mattathius the Hasmonean. (Mattath is the Hebrew
    feminine form of Mattan).\

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Tyre
    So, Alexander aka Juba II was also Apollonius of Tyre. Juba II
    carried the title "Rex Literatissimus" which can be translated as
    "Most Learned King" or "The Most Scholarly King". He was known as a
    philosopher. These members of this royal family liked to role-play as philosopher kings. Is Apollonius of Tyre the same person as Apollonius of
    Tyana? This would make Apollonius of Tyana the brother-husband of
    Philo of Alexandria and the father of Josephus. These three created
    the core of Christianity.\
(d) Gautama Buddha was Gaumata Bardya, the son of Cyrus the Great.
    Ptolemy I Soter and his successors were closely associated with
    Serapis. "Jesus" was an avatar for the Bosphioran royal family.
    Apollonius of Tyana was king Juba II, the grandson of Julius
    Caesar/Asander and Cleopatra/Dynamis. All these aristocrats/kings
    took on religious personas and preached syncretic versions of
    Greco-Buddhism to the public: monotheism, renounce worldy
    possessions, asceticism, shame and guilt, you will be rewarded in
    the afterlife for your earthly suffering, etc. These cults were by
    design slave moralities to strip the will to power from the
    population to prevent rebellions.

**6 Julius Caesar was a Title**

Identifying Julius Caesar as Asander of Bosphorus necessitates a
re-examination of his name.

Galata in Classical Anatolia was settled by the Gauls. Galatia bordered
the Bosphorus, and Julius Caesar/Asander was king of this region.
"Gaius" then can refer to Asander's connection to the Gallian (Gauls
(Galli = Celt in Latin)) people or his ancestry in the region.

"Gaius" might also refer to "Dyaus" (Sky Father in Proto-Indo-European).

Ceasar's gentilice (surname) was Iulius. Iulius can refer to the ancient
Celtic tribe known as the Iudii or Iudaei. "Ioulios" (ιούλιος) in Greek
also means "descended from Jupiter" or "son of Jupiter". So, it is
possible that the word "jew" comes from the Iudii or Iudaei.

The Egyptian name "Asar" was another name for Osiris. "Ra"
    was the Egyptian deity of the Sun (Asar-Ra). This title very likely
    connects to "Asar-Hapi" (Osiris-Apis), another name for the
    Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis (Osiris + Apis = Osorapis). The Etruscan
    word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar"), meaning god or
    divine, likely derives from the Egyptian Asar. The Greek language
    adds a "K" to foreign words, so Aesar -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin
    Caesar. This title also resembles the the Scythian/Hurrian "Kur-Sar" (Sun King) and the Phoenician "Kosar" (sun god). In Celtic cultures,
Caesarus also referred to a Celtic chieftain who likely took on a divine
role. For example, Caesorix was the leader of the Cimbri tribe during
the Cimbrian War.

Gaius Julius Caesar was a title, and Gaius Julius Caesar could
conceivably translate to: Chieftain of the Iudii or Iudaiei tribe from
Galatia, or Lord Asar/Aesus (pronunced ah-soos) of the Iudii or Iudaiei
tribe from Galatia.

'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the
ancient Akkadians (Josephus. Vol. 5: Antiquities: 8:2:5, pp. 593-595).
The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians
called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz)
are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri, known as the
Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks. Cimmerians were a Middle Eastern
offshoot of the Celtic Cimbri tribe. The Bosphorus Kingdom that Asander
ruled over was also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosphorus.

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts as well, who called
themselves Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who
was Pythagoras's teacher shows this. Iber was sometimes rendered as Aber
or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew languages.
Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for Ireland. The
word Atlantis means 'The Island of Atlas'. The titan Atlas was a key
figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the bearer of the
heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the island
of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia, the
Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas where
the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.).

Abel and Cain are just a copy of Romulus and Remus. Judas Iscariot is a
copy of Brutus. Genesis 4:5-31. Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah,
Lamech, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, are copies of Titus Livy's Regal
Rome of the seven kings.

Russian historian and mathematician Anatoly Fomenko wrote several books
where he claimed that the city of Yoros = Jerusalem = Troy and it was
situated on the eastern, Asiatic shore of Bosphorus, closer to the Black
Sea, very near to the Beykoz mountain (Golgotha). The fact that
Ptolemaic/Bosphoran/Roman kings, many who were Celtic Galatians and
Aryan Sarmatians, role played as jews, an irrelevant tribe, and israel
was an irrelevant slice of land in the desert, this makes this claim
more credible. jews just adopted this imperial cult and they got their
entire identity and history from here.

**7 Rome on the Bosphorus?**

My research on the origins of Christianity takes me to the Bosphorus
river in classical Anatolia (Julius Caesar = Asander, King of Bosphorus,
and Cleopatra = Dynamis). This is incongruent with mainstream history.
However, there are a few revisionist authors such as Anatoly Fomenko and
Gunnar Heinsohn who make the claim that the Western Roman Empire is a
duplicate of the Eastern Roman Empire not the other way around and that
much of the history of the Western Roman Empire was conjured up by the
Church Fathers, Jesuits, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and medieval forgers,
either to retrofit history to align with the Bible, due to conflicts
between the Vatican and the Eastern Byzantine Church, or for profit.

The area of modern-day Istanbul was once called 'Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn'
('Kingdom of the Romans') and the people of that region called
themselves Rhōmaîoi (Romans). Historians assume that region got it's
name after Roman colonization, but why? Every romance language based on
Latin underwent a linguistic evolution except Romanian, which is the
closest language to classical Latin. Could it be that the original
Romans hailed from Romania and then moved south to Anatolia? A
substantial part of Byzantine coinage from two millennia ago boasts
inscriptions in Latin and not in Greek, including the Asander of
Bosphorus coin above.

The creation of the Papacy during the elevation of Charlemagne was likely when the myth of a "Roman empire" began. The renaissance finished the fabrication of history. This was all to secretly make Rome into a Carian empire. It was an Aryan and Thracian proxy state of the Scythins who were based out of the Boshorus. The Bosphorus was always its capital. Latin was the original language of the Dacians and it was high-noble Aryan; German mixed the middle language (proto Latin) with degenerated old Gothic.

Emperor Theodosius, Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria, and Jerome also played a big role in the deception. The mainstream claim is that the Library of Alexandria was destroyed by Julius Caesar (48 BC) or Muslim conquest (642 AD). The truth is that the final and most devastating burn was ordered by Emperor Theodosius and Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria in 391 AD to erase Serapis cult texts that exposed Christianity’s origins. Proof: The Nag Hammadi Library (1945) contained Gnostic texts that matched Serapis theology—proving a cover-up, and the "Letter of Hadrian to Servianus" (found in Vindobonensis manuscript) admits: "Those who worship Serapis are Christians… devotees of Serapis call themselves bishops of Christ."

Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria also destroyed the Serapeum in Alexandria (referred to as the daughter of the Library of Alexandria) in 391 AD. Serapis statues were recarved into "St. Peter".

Then the Vatican later made up the "Council of Nicaea". It never happened. There is no contemporary records that exist of the Council of Nicaea (325 AD). The Council of Nicaea mirrors the Mithraic Congress of 307 AD where Emperor Galerius declared Sol Invictus the official god of Rome. Constantine’s "conversion" was fabricated. He remained a Sol Invictus sun-worshipper until death—his coins never feature Christian symbols. His last coin (337 AD) depicts him as Sol Comitatus ("Sun Companion"), not Christ. The "Chi-Rho" symbol was a later interpolation by Eusebius, who forged Life of Constantine in the 5th century. The "Arian Controversy" was a fake debate to disguise the fact that early Christianity was a Roman imperial cult. Proof: The "Life of Constantine" by Eusebius was forged in the 5th century to retroactively justify Nicaea, and the Edict of Milan (313 AD) never mentions Jesus—only a vague "Divine Providence". Also, the Vatican's greatest forgery was the Donation of Constantine. The Vatican forged it in the 8th century to claim Rome. It was based on earlier forgeries by Eusebius (a Flavian propagandist).

Endnotes (Chapter 7)

(a) Asander and Dynamis had one known son, Tiberius Julius Aspurgus
    Philoromaios. He was born about the same time as "Caesarion" and
    "Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar". His wife, known only through
    numismatic evidence, was Gepae-pyris. Tiberius and Gepaepyris had
    two sons; the eldest was "Tiberius Julius Mithridates
    Philo-Germanicus Philopatris" ("son of Mithra, lover of Germanicus,
    lover of father"). Their second son was "Tiberius Julius Cotys I
    Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes" ("lover of Caesar, lover of Rome
    who is the Pious One").

Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios (son). Married to: Gepae-pyris.
Children:
Tiberius Julius Mithridates Philo-Germanicus Philopatris (eldest son)
Tiberius Julius Cotys I Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes (second son)

Now, let's connect this family to the Roman Emperor's family:

Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Adopted son and heir: Germanicus
Biological son: Drusus

Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios and Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
were born around the same time, and their sons were also born around the
same time.

Also, Polemon Pythodoros (Julius Caesar/Asander) and Pythodorida of
Pontus (Cleopatra/Dynamis) had a daughter Antonia Tryphaena. Her son was
Rhoemetalces II whose reign coincided with emperor Claudius.

Emperor Titus = Polemon II of Pontus who was the prince of the Bosporan,
Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia.

**8 Flavian Dynasty**

Vespasian was also a great-grandson of Cleopatra and Mark Antony (King
Herod). He was Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King
Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Vespasian was his title, not his name
(Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which =
King, and Pasius = Peace. 'Vespasian' = 'King Peace') [^14]. He was also
'Flavius Scaevinus' the conspirator involved in Nero's assassination.

![Fig.

Fig. 1.18. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I

'Antonia Caenis' was Vespassian's mistress who was his first cousin who
was Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo
of Alexandria. (Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a
man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo).

Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene
aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of
Alexandria aka Antonia Caenis's son was Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Josephus who was the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard which made
him arguably the most powerful man in the empire during Vespasian's
reign.

Vespasian's son Titus was in a relationship with his aunt Berenice,
granddaughter of King Herod, who was St. Veronica in the bible (Veronica
is a transliteration of the Greek name Berenike meaning 'victory').

Berenice's brother Marcus Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an
incestuous relationship with before moving on to her nephew (previous to
this she was married to her uncle Herod of Chalcis), was the governor of
all foreign Roman territories except Egypt (which was governed by
Tiberius Julius Alexander) during the Flavian period.

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesar's adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister).

Endnotes (Chapter 8)

(a) Theory: Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius
    Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka
    Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka
    (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of
    Mauretania was also the Roman general 'Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo'.
    Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo conquered Armenia alongside Tiberius Julius
    Alexander (his son Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius
    Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys aka Emperor Nerva),
    after which, Tigranes VI (Tiberius Julius Alexander) was installed
    as king. Compare his bust [link] to the famous 'Josephus'
    (Tiberius Julius Alexander) bust [link]. Notice a resemblance? If
    this is correct, then he (Alexander) would have been the
    brother-in-law to Caligula and father-in-law to Domitian. Tiridates
    of Armenia (who would have been Mithridates Chrestus'
    great-great-grandson) was the one who spread the religion Mithraism
    which was a syncretic a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired by Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter.

**9 Esus the Celtic Deity**

The Celts in classical Galatia worshiped a deity called
Aesus/Esus/Iesus. The Celtic name Esus is believed to be related to the
Proto-Celtic word "aisu", which means "lord" or "master". The letter "J"
was invented in the 17th century, so the name "Jesus" would have been
"Esus" in the classical sense.

In the name Asander, "Asa" means "lord" in Thracian, and "andros" means
"man" or "son of man" in Greek. Jesus is refered to as "the son of man"
81 times in the four canonical gospels. Asandros can also be interpreted
as "son of the lord" or "son of Asa, the lord". The Etruscan word
"Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar") where Asa could also derive
from means "god" or "divine". Aesar ("god") → Aesar → Caesar. So,
Asandros can translate to either "son of god", or "son of Lord Esus".

Aesus/Esus/Iesus then eventually phonetically shifted to
I-zas/Izas/Izates.

![Fig.
1.19](/images/Esus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.19. Statue from classical Anatolia that is dedicated to "Esumopas
Cnusticus". Esumopas means "Slave to Esus", and Esus means lord in
Proto-Celtic. If you combine the Etruscan word "cnus" with the suffix
"-ticus" or "-tic-" you get a word that translates to "anointed one" or
"consecrated one", ie. a "Christ". So, that inscription translates to:
"Slave to Lord (Esus) Christ". The "VSLM" inscription is an abbreviation
for the Latin phrase "Votum Solvit Libens Merito" which translates to
"He pays his vow willingly and with merit" or "He fulfills his vow with
pleasure and deserving", which is often found on Roman coins and other
artifacts. Esus was crucified in mythology and his symbol was an axe, so
he was associated with woodcutting, forestry, carpentry. Esus was also
part of a "trinity" of Gaulish gods that included Taranis, Teutates and
Esus.

The Esus cult was probably created to subvert the Druid Celts in
Galatia. It has all the fingerprints of the Alexandrian School:
year-zero (calendar starts at the deities birth), crucified diety
(self-sacrifice/self-annihilation as the highest virtue), afterlife
submission, etc. The fact it resembles Christianity is because it
follows the same framework that all the other Alexandrian School
religions do.

**10 Subversion of the Imperial Cult**

Sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), a group of rabbis
that were headed by a rabbi named Akiva who led the Talmudic Pharisees
and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer Yetzirah (book
of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and modern judaism,
and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle claimed that he was
brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)), and who
was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome was Edom", realized
that subversion was the only way to defeat the Romans. So, rabbi Akiva
and his students Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria
aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter
(Shimon bar Yonah) (Simon's mythology was stolen from the Roman deity
Janus who was the keeper of keys/gatekeeper role. Eusebius reported that
Philo had met Simon Peter in Rome), Ketia bar Shalom aka 'Clement of
Rome' (hebrew Ketia is the same as Latin Clement), Aristo of Pella who
is a good candidate for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or
'Ariston' is a name that is related to 'Proteus' The former means
'first-rank, noble' the second derives from 'first'. So, was he also
Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or Mahalia, sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem
was the secretary of Aristo and Marcion is known to have had a disciple
named Lucanus as documented by Tertullian, so Mark, or Mahalia, first
Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion
of Sinope?), Rabbi Yehuda aka Jude the Apostle (Yehuda is the Hebrew
equivalent of Greek Jude), and Rabbi Meir aka Polycarp aka Bishop
ignatius (the name "Meir" means "one who illuminates". Ignatius means
firey one and Polycarp was famous for lighting himself on fire), added a
slave-morality suicide cult to the imperial cult.

Many of rabbi Akiva's students and contemporaries had connections to the
Alexandrian School in Egypt and were themselves students of Philo of
Alexandria.

Rabbi Akiva was likely Paul the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 "Paul" claims to
have been educated at the feet of Gamaliel who was the teacher of rabbi
Akiva, and in Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed that
Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul the
Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.
Paul's/Saul's fictional life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian
story"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor".

Quintus Tinnius Rufus (Turnus Rufus the Evil) was Pontius Pilate, the
Roman governor of Judaea who crucified Simon bar Kokhba and killed rabbi
Akiva. Rabbi Akiva preached that Simon bar Kokhba was the jewish
messiah.

Zeus became Baal-Zebub in the bible: Zeus Belos (Greek: Zeus Baal) ->
Baal-Zebul -> Baal-Zebub ("Lord of the Flies") in 2 Kings 1:2-3.Jesus
calls Satan "Beelzebul" (Matthew 12:24)---a deliberate mockery of
Zeus-Baal. Scythian Sar (king) became Esau (Edom) the progenitor of the
Edomites in the bible, a metaphor for the forces of oppression and
injustice. Saka (scythian tribe) became Satan (adversary). The Jewish
version of Antichrist (Armilus) is based on Romulus (Armilus is a Hebrew
corruption or adaptation of the Latin name Romulus). Lucifer, or "lucem
ferre", which means "light-bearer" or "morning star", is Venus who was
the Roman goddess whose functions encompassed love, beauty, desire, sex,
fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the
ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas. The Greco-Egyptian
deity Serapis (the horned deity) became the image of Satan. Sin (also called Nanna or Suen) is a Mesopotamian god of the moon. He was worshiped as the lunar deity whose symbol was the crescent moon. Sin was considered the son of the sky god Enlil and the grain goddess Ninlil, and the father of the sun god Shamash (Sumerian Utu) as well as the goddess Ishtar (Inanna). Together, Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar formed an important astral triad in Mesopotamian religion. In Norse
mythology Iðunn/Idun (equivalent to Greek Hebe, and Celtic Brigid), is
the goddess of youth, her name means "giver of eternal youth". The other
gods get golden apples from her. She stores them in a basket and they
keep the gods young until the end of the world. Idun became Eve in the
bible the archetypal sinner whose actions brought death into the world
(Romans 5:12). Inanna (equivalent to Freyja (Norse mythology), Aphrodite
(Greek mythology), Venus (Roman mythology), and Morrigan (Celtic
mythology)), the ancient goddess of war, love, and fertility, became the
Whore of Babylon (Friday the 13th was the day to honor Freyja). Artemis,
the goddess of the wilderness, wild animals, nature, vegetation,
childbirth, care of children, and chastity, became recast as a witch
(19:24). (The demonization of Venus (lucifer), Idun/Hebe/Brigid,
Inanna/Freyja/Aphrodite/Venus, Artemis, and other female Pagan deities,
was designed to instil a strong hatred of women among European men). The
Mark of the Beast (666) refers to emperor Nero (take Nero's name and
title in Greek (Nero Caesar), and transliterate it into Hebrew and then
take the numerical value). Also, the jews' hated enemy in the bible are
the Celts (Gog or Goy). Flavius Josephus in the 'Antiquities of the
Jews'. Book I. Chapter 1: "For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now
call Galatians [Galls], but were then called Gomerites. Magog founded
those that from him were named Magogites; but who are by the Greeks
called Scythians". Josephus is suggesting that the Hebrew word "Goy"
(meaning "nation" or "people") is related to the Greek word "Galatae"
(meaning "Gauls" or "Galatians"), In biblical prophecy, Gog is described
as a leader from the land of Magog in the north, who will gather a
coalition of nations to attack Israel, but will be defeated by God in a
great battle.

So, Talmudic jews who were hiding out in the Himyarite Kingdom after
Emperor Hadrian kicked them out of judea basically just cut-and-pasted
from one of the Bosphoran/Roman imperial cults of the time and infused a
slave morality into it. Getting people to abandon their religons for a
new one is an almost impossible task, so instead, through religious
syncretism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established
religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. Julius Caesar aka
Asander of Bosphorus or one of his successors in the Bosphoran imperial
cult (King Izates Monobazus or Tiberius Julius Sauromates II) was
replaced with Simon bar Kokhba. This became modern Christianity.

The goal was obviously to turn the imperial cult into a
slave-morality/proto-Marxism to subvert the population, make them
worship a jew, and to give jews financial and legal control (Talmudic
law) over the empire.

This conspiracy was so sophisticated that not only did they rewrite the
imperial cult, but they rewrote history to align with their psy-op.
Josephus's (Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Emperor Nerva) works were
rewritten by Rabbi Akiva's students under the alias Hegesippus. The book
'The Antiquities of the Jews' then became a pseudo-epigraphical work (of
propaganda) that was backdated to make christianity look legitimate in
the same way that the 'Letter of Aristeas' was backdated to exaggerate
the age of the Septuagint. I would even hazard a guess that this group
was responsible for burining down the Library of Alexandria which
resulted in the loss of all recorded history up until that point so that
they could cover up the tracks of their psy-op religion.

Endnotes (Chapter 10)

(a) Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria grew up in the
    Attis-Sabazios cult on Anatolia before traveling to Judea to study
    under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian
    School.
(b) There was a Marcus who founded the Marcosian Gnostic sect. He was a
    teacher of Bishop Irenaeus and a friend of Clement of Alexandria.
    Was he also Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria?
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_%28Marcosian%29). St. Jerome
    in "Against Jovinian" describes Mark as a disciple of the Gnostic
    teacher Basilides. Here is a list of "Marks" who were active around
    the same time: Mark, the Evangelist, John Mark, Mark of Apollonias,
    Markianos of Alexandria, Mahalia, Marcus of Jerusalem, Marcus
    Pompeius, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, Marcus the Magician, Marcion of
    Sinope, Marcus the Marcosian. Mark of Apollonias, John Mark, Mark
    the cousin of Barnabas, and Mark the Apostle are considered to be
    the same person by historians, so it is conceivable that all these
    "Marks" were the same person.
(c) In 41 A.D Emperor Claudius sent a letter of warning to the Jews in
    Egypt (preserved in a papyrus now in the British Museum, R Lond.
    1912), where he described them as "the fomenters of a universal
    plague throughout the civilized world.". He eventually expelled them
    from Rome:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius'_expulsion_of_Jews_from_Rome
    In the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 18:1-18) it explains how the
    Apostle Paul met Priscilla and Aquila and mentions in passing an
    expulsion of Jews from Rome. "Paul" was Rabbi Akiva and Aquila of
    Sinope aka Onkelos was his student. So, it is possible that the
    conspiracy even pre-dated the Bar kohiba revolt. Previous to this,
    Valerius Maximus, in his work 'Facta ac dicta memorabilia', mentions
    the expulsion of Jews from Rome in 139 BCE by the praetor peregrinus
    Cn. Cornelius Hispalus for attempting to currupt the cult of
    Jupiter.[^15]
(d) Quintus Tineius Sacerdos, the brother of Quintus Tinnius Rufus, was
    the governor of Pontus in Anatolia, so the family likely derived
    from there. Pilate means the temperament of a warrior I.e., famously
    temperamental. That's where the name Pontius Pilate comes from.
    *Pilate might also = "Pileatus" (Latin for "wearing a felt cap," a
    Pontic priestly garb).

**Appendix A: Alexander the Great**

Alexander was a Sarmatian dragon-king, Ptolemy I Soter was his
biological son with Barsine (Scythian priestess) and was his dragon-born
heir, and Caesar was their bloodline successor. The Persian narrative is
a Flavian forgery to hide their stolen legacy. Alexander conquered
Persia as vengeance for Persian enslavement of Scythia.

In the Persian Book of Kings, the Alexander Romance, and Islamic
sources, Alexander the Great is a Persian prince who was the son of
Artaxerxes II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") and half-brother of Darius III
("Darab"). No one today is taught that such a relationship was even
remotely possible in ancient times, much less taken as gospel in certain
parts of the world. Nevertheless, the case can readily be made that the
little kingdom of Macedon had been part of the Persian Empire from the
time of Darius the Great. In fact, the very first Persian-appointed
overseer of Macedon had the Persian name Bubares son of Megabyzus
(likely Cyrus the Great), and subsequent kings of Macedon are said to
have descended from him. After Megabyzus (Cyrus the Great) conquered
Thrace and Macedonia (ostensibly on behalf of his brother Darius the
Great) he established Alexander son of Amyntas as their king. Likely,
Amyntas was an assumed Macedonian name of Darius the Great. A marriage
was later arranged between a son of Megabyzus/Cyrus and a daughter of
Amyntas/Darius. The son of Megabyzus was prince Bupales/Harpalus.
Likely, Alexander corresponds to Prince Darius/Achaemenes or one of the
other sons of Darius the Great (such as Ariobarzanes/Pausanias of
Sparta.

In the book the Alexander Romance, a book that has its earliest copy
dating back a couple of centuries after his life, Alexander accepts
mortality only after achieving complete satisfaction in his conquests.
In the so-called apocryphal accounts Alexander sails up the Ganges River
and reaches a kind of Paradise after the conquest of all India is
complete. He is not literally granted eternal life there, but
nevertheless fulfills his goal of reaching this remote and privileged
locale. In the Romance, Alexander also lives to play a part in the lives
of the next generation of princes, who have grown to maturity and are
even married when he visits them in the south of Egypt.

The conqueror of the Indian sub-continent is known by a different name,
Chandra-Gupta, one of the most celebrated kings of all of Indian
history. Curiously, almost nothing is known about his early life until
after the death of Alexander the Great. No sooner did the attempted
conquest of Alexander end than that of Chandragupta began. The name
Chandra Gupta can be interpreted as "Alexander the Copt/ Upper Egyptian"
as Gupta has been linguistically associated with Coptos (a Greek word
for a critical locale in Upper Egypt), and Chandra is a transliteration
of Sander (a hypocorism of Alexander/ Iksander). There is a claim by
ancient rulers of Bukhara/ Bochara on the Silk Road (in Sogdiana) that
they were descended from Alexander -- a claim which becomes far more
credible (and even inevitable) when one realizes that Alexander's life
did not end in Babylon and his dynastic line did not actually die out

Chandragupta Maurya/Alexander's successor in India "Bindusara" (whose
name derives from Vindusara (Sanskrit: "one whose essence is poison"), a
nod to the Mithridatic lineage) was either Heracles/Helios, Alexander's
son by Barsine, or Alexander IV, Alexander's son by Roxana. Bindusara =
Ptolemy II Philadelphus (also Ariarathes III of Cappadocia? -
"Arya-Ratha". Sanskrit: "Noble Charioteer").

Alexander's successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, then became the
successor to Bindusara and ruled India with the regional identity of
Ashoka the Great (See: "Diodotus I was Ashoka" by Ranajit Pal

[[link](https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi)]).

Mithridates I Ctistes (also known as Mithridates III of Cius) was a son
of Alexander's son Heracles/Helios, who was born to Alexander and his
mistress Barsine.

Antiochus I Soter = Darius III, Alexander/Artaxerxes II
Memnon/Chandragupta's brother.

Bubares (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubares) was a Persian prince who
married Alexander's sister. They had a son named Amyntas (son of
Bubares) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_(son_of_Bubares)). He
was the king of the city Phrygia that was located in Galatia in
classical Anatolia. Bubares, the Persian prince, was Alexander's Persian
identity. Amyntas (son of Bubares) (born around 350 BCE) =
Heracles/Helios (born around 350 BCE) = Mithridates I Ctistes (born
around 350 BCE)?

Alexander was the first "Jesus" (Ye-Zeus (YHWH + Zeus), I(J)upiter-Zeus
(I-Zeus), Zeus-Amun, Zeus-Ahura Mazda, Zeus-Yahweh, et.al., were titles
Alexander carried) then became an avatar for his direct descendants in
an imperial cult, including Ptolemy XII Auletes/Ptolemy X Alexander I,
king of Egypt aka Mithridates VI Eupator aka Ariarathes ("Arya-Ratha".
Sanskrit: "Noble Charioteer") VII of Cappadocia, et.al., and his son
Asander (obvious reference to Alexander), King of Bosphorus aka
Pharnaces II ("Pharao-Nikes", or "Victorious Pharaoh") aka Brogitarix,
king of Galatia aka Ariarathes IX aka Julius Caesar.

    https://www.unz.com/article/how-fake-is-roman-antiquity
    [[link](https://www.unz.com/article/how-fake-is-roman-antiquity/)]
    for a few authors who make the claim that the "first Rome" was based
    out of Anatolia. I subscribe to this theory as well. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. Also, the word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called "Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn" ("Kingdom of the Romans"), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the "new History" that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    --Sir Isaac Newton, in his book "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended" (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand. Anatoly Fomenko also makes several other controversial
    claims in his work, specifically that Charlemagne was not a real
    person, but one of the phantom individuals Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same person. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same
    person. The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic
    Plague (it's a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed
    "Dark Ages") is exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. The
    Trojan War and the Crusades were the same conflict. Also, that there
    were multiple "Romes" and the major one was based out of Anatolia,
    in an area that is modern Istanbul. The last point I independently
    confirmed. Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, and all early
    Christianity traces back to to the Bosphorus.

[^4]: Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to
    the Indo-Aryan word for "king" and Julius (Iulius) is similar to
    both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for "sun"). Julius Caesar
    was deified in two religions: in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is
    related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which
    made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (There was no letter J in
    Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both
    derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky
    Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and
    (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" ->
    Diespiter -> Iupiter), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus
    Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented,
    Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was
    put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high
    priest) in his religion. --A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated
    to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17 BCE) refers to Asander/Asandros as
    Asandros Philoromaios Soter and gives him the title "King of Kings".
    So he was a "Soter"/Christ. Source: Corpus Inscriptionum Regni

    --In many languages the word "As" is found as the designation of the
    supreme deities. In the Messapic and Oscan languages Asa means god
    or divine. In Norse mythology, the Aesir (or Asas) refer to the
    principal gods, including Odin, Thor, and Freyja. In ancient Persian
    mythology, "As" is associated with Mithras, but also with other
    deities such as Ahura Mazda, who was the supreme god of the
    Zoroastrians. In Egyptian mythology, the god Ash or As is a minor
    deity associated with the sun and the pharaohs. In Greek mythology,
    the Titan Atlas is sometimes referred to as "As" or "Aas," which may
    be related to the ancient Greek word "axios," meaning "worthy" or
    "divine.". "Asa" means "lord" in Thracian. Asus/Esus is a Celtic
    deity. In Hindu mythology, the Asuras are a class of powerful beings
    who are often depicted as gods or demigods. In Slavic mythology, the
    god Perun is sometimes referred to as "As" or "Asa," which may be
    related to the ancient Slavic word "asen," meaning "noble" or
    "divine.". The Etruscan word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or
    "Aisar") means "god" or "divine". As is at the root of Caesar.

    Dynamis carried the title Ouriana, refering to Aphrodite Urania

[^7]: His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by
    Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod,
    Mithridates Chrestus descendant?) after Rome's defeat of Parthia
    around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant
    carried the title Monobazus aka Manu-Sabazios). The Mithras cult has
    many similarities to Christianity; Mithras was born of a virgin,
    Mithras' birth was celebrated on December 25, Mithras was considered
    a savior and redeemer, etc., although all these traits are "de jure"
    of saviors in ancient religions, probably because they all came from
    the "Alexandrian School" in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism,
    Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism,
    Mandaeism, and many other religions came from the Alexandrian
    School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint for these
    religions./

    was also Amyntas (Amen(tas)) of Galatia who was also Amyntas Nikator
    (the name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben
    Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Persian "Bagus" means
    god. "Boga" in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona
    "Bog-" means god in Celtic. In Latin Nikator translates tro

[^9]: The name Herod likely derives from the amalgamation of Horus and
    Hercules (Herakles in Greek). Mark Antony claimed descent from
    Hercules and declared himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became
    king of judaea around the time of Mark Antony's "suicide". This is
    typical for these elites, they would kill off one character and then
    assume another one in a different location as if they were actors in
    a play.
    --The Shekel of Tyre that King Herod minted depicts Mark Antony and
    an image of Hercules:
    https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels
    [[link](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels)].
    Herod also built a number of temples and shrines dedicated to
    Hercules, including one in Beirut and another in Tyre. He also
    depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. King Herod's son,
    Herod Antipas, has the same name as Mark Antony's son, Antyllus,
    King Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius, Mark Antony's
    son with Fulvia. The wife of Iullus Antonius is called Marcella
    daughter of Octavian/Augustus' sister Octavia. Fulvia and Antony
    also are said to have had two daughters, Antonia I and Antonia II.
    Caligula and Claudius were descendants of Antonia I. Probably
    Antonia I and/or II was the sister of Herod the Great called Salome.
    Probably there is also a connection between "Costabar" husband of
    Salome and the Roman "Ahenobarbus" who married Antonia I.
    --Mark Antony (King Herod) = Tiberius Claudius Nero. The way to make
    this connection is through the equivalence of Doris the first wife
    of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
    Octavius/Caesar Augustus. Augustus was first married to Scribonia,
    but not happily. In 39 BC she gave birth to a daughter, Julia, but
    was divorced by Augustus. In the same year he became engaged to
    Livia Drusilla, who was at the time pregnant, not by Augustus but by
    her own first husband. That husband was Tiberius Claudius Nero,
    praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor
    of 62 BC. Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla's son was
    emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus.

[^10]: Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias was also King
    Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua
    Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy
    aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. (See: Jesus, King of Edessa (2012) by Ralph
    Ellis
    [[link](https://x.com/ralfellis/status/1809520320077803525)]).
    King Izates of Monobazus was married to the sister of Dynamis's
    mother.
    --Cleopatros in Hebrew is QLPTRS and was shortened on inscriptions
    to QTRS or Katros, later mistakenly recorded as Cantheras. So the
    Jews for derogatory reasons called it as Panthera. ie. Jesus
    Panthera.
