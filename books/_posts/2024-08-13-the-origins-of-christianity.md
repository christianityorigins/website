1 Name and Title Meanings

-   Christ: In Greek "The Anointed One" is Chréstos/Christ or Soter. Several historical figures were Christs/Soters. In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus the Great "The Anointed One". Alexander the Great was also a Chréstos/Soter (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b).
-   Cotys: In Thracian, "Cotys" is related to the word "kotys" which is a title that means "lord".
-   Izates or Izas: An ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning "lord".
-   Monobazus: Sabazios is the Phrygian and Thracian version of Zeus. Ma'nu is likely a diminutive of Menneus ("son of man"), and then Manu-Sabazios becomes Monobazus. Monobazus also becomes "Bazus" or "Bar Izates" shortened to "baYZTus" (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which then becomes "bOETHus". The Boethusians were a jewish priestly sect.
-   Piso cognomen: "Appius" is a cognomen (personal name) of the Claudian family. Appius and Piso are synonymous (In Greek, Appius is rendered as Appios, from there Piso). The name Piso itself would be a form of Peisistratos/Pisistratos, the leading name of ancient Athens in Greece. (Pisistratos is a Latinized spelling of the Greek Peisistratos) It could be said that all the ruling elite of the Julio-Claudian dynasty were Piso's, including Nero who was nearly deposed by a Piso. Appius is also cognate with Arrius (through rhotacization in ancient Latin the /p/ and /r/ could be swapped).

2 The Creation of Christianity

The early rulers of Sumer were all priests, while in Egypt, the Pharaohs claimed to be sons of gods. The Persians also deified their leaders, taking it a step further by incorporating a slave-morality religion into their imperial cult as part of their colonial program. They created Zoroastrianism and Buddhism (Gautama Buddha being Gaumata Bardya, the son of Cyrus the Great, who governed the Persian province of Bactra). The Greeks followed with the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander and the Serapis cult, and the Romans established their own imperial cults. These imperial powers maintained their empires through religious syncretism and slave-morality religions, which stripped the population of their will to power, while using an incredible number of regional aliases, locations, fictional stories, faked adoptions, and fabricated deaths for their family members to maintain their empire and prevent any rebellion. Christianity is a relic of one of these imperial slave moralities which itself was subverted by a confederaion of rabbis after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE).

3 Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus \

There was a Byzantine [^1] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^2] took
on the role of Asander, King of Bosphorus [^3] (the city of Byzantine,
later called Constantinople and now Istanbul was/is located in the area
called Bosphorus), and his wife Cleopatra used the regional alias of
Dynamis Ourania [^4] (translates to 'heavenly power'), queen of
Bosporus.

![Fig.1.4](/images/Cleopatra%20VIIDynamis.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.4. (L) Dynamis, Queen of Bosphorus, (R) Cleopatra VII. There was obviously many years in between the ages that she was depicted, however, even in the elder Dynamis bust you can see her lazy eye and abnormally large eyes which she was reported to have had, possibly as a consequence of inbreeding. 

![Fig.1.5](/images/cleopatra.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.5. (L) Julia Mamaea, Queen of Pontus (wife of Polemon II), (R)
Cleopatra VII. Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus was Julius Caesar/Asander's
regional alias (Asander and Polemon were both married to Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She
would have been married to her half-brother (Cleopatra and Mark Antony's son) Polemon II, King of Pontus
aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom,
also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next
to the Pontus Kingdom

Asander was born in 110BCE, the same year as Julius Caesar. Dynamis was
born in 70/69 BCE, the same year as Cleopatra VII. Julius Caesar was 30
years older than Cleopatra, and Asander was also 30 years older than
Dynamis.

A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17
BCE), refers to as Asander as the 'Great King of Kings Asandros
Philoromaios Soter' (Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani 30). So, he
was a 'King of Kings', Soter (savior), and 'The Great'. Individually,
each of those titles carry significance, but the 'Great King of Kings'
title in that inscription stands out because it is a rare title that was
used by Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great, so this shows Asanders
level of prestige and power to be placed along side those two. Julius
Caesar is the only historical figure who had a comparable level of
prestige as Cyrus and Alexander.

Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who also carried the
title "King of Kings". Her uncle was Mithridates 'Chrestus' [^5].
Mithridates translates to 'the gift of Mithra' in ancient Persian and is
an obvious reference to the Mithras cult. Asander beat Mithridates
Chrestus in battle to become King of Bosphorus. One source I read
claimed that this was a fratricidal war and that Asander and Mithridates
Chrestus were brothers. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the city is
founded as the result of a fratricide, with the twins Romulus and Remus
quarreling over who has the favour of the gods and over each other's
plans to build Rome, with Romulus becoming Rome's first king and
namesake after killing his brother (this also mirrors the biblical
account of Cain and Abel). This would make Asander Dynamis's uncle and
husband. Asander beating Mithridates Chrestus in battle to become ruler
of Bosphorus also parallels Julius Caesar beating Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus
(Pompey the Great) to become ruler of Rome. If they were in fact
brothers, then Mithridates VI Eupator's son Machares was born in 110BCE,
the same year as Asander and Julius Caesar, so that would be his real
name.

Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen
(Jesus Amen of Rev. iii. 14) [^6] was married to Stratonice who was the
sister of Asander. He was also a cousin of Dynamis and Asander. Amyntas
Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia ruled an empire that stretched from
modern day Turkey through India.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Julius Caesar aka Asander = Tiberius
Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios, who was born about the same time as
Caesarion (Aspurgus translates to "horseman-lord" in Thracian languages.
Sabazios was a Thracian deity worshipped as a horseman).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony [^7](aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander Helios
aka Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his
twin sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is most likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal (one way to prove that Mark Antony was also King
Herod is through the equivalence of Alexander Helios aka Alexander (son
of King Herod) aka Juba II).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Ptolemy
Philadelphus who was Sampsiceramus I?

Mark Antony's (aka King Herod aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV
of Parthia) son with Livia Drusilla = emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Augustus (one way to prove that Mark Antony was both King Herod and
Tiberius Claudius Nero is through the equivalence of Doris the first
wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
Octavius/Caesar Augustus (the Greek name Doris is a transliteration of
the Roman Drus-us). Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but was
divorced and he became engaged to Livia Drusilla (Doris), who was at the
time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband Tiberius
Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius
Nero, praetor of 62 BC).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria' (aka Julius Philo, of the Julia gens, because she was the adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar). She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary Pallas and Vespasian's first cousin and mistress Antonia Caenis. "The full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas, the Antonius part is an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony and that Pallas wasn't a random slave. 

![Fig.

Fig. 1.6. (L) Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius
Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander the Alabarch aka
(King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of
Mauretania aka "Jesus" in the bible. (R) Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Alexandra bat Mattathias aka 'Philo of
Alexandria'.

Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister wife Cleopatra (Thea
Philopator) of Mauretania had two sons: Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys (In
Thracian, 'Cotys' is related to the word 'kotys' which is a title that
means 'lord') aka Emperor Nerva, and Marcus Julius Alexander aka Yeshua
Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ma'nu of
Adiabene/Edessa aka Ptolemy aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy aka Izates aka Jesus
Emmanuel aka Monobazus of Adiabene [^8]

![Fig.
1.7](/images/Josephus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.7. 'Josephus' bust which I identify as
Tiberius Julius Alexander. Compare it to Nerva's depictions. So, 'Josephus' was Philo of Alexandria's son. Tiberius Julius Alexander's son was named 'Philopappos' and one of his mothers aliases was 'Alexandria bat Matthias' which is where the pseudonym 'Joseph bar Matthias' comes from. Also, drop the initial b and final s in the name "Bar Mathias" and you get (Joseph of) Arimathea.

![Fig. 1.8](/images/coin-abgar-phraates.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.8. (L) and (R) show King Izates Monobazus of Edessa (known in
Greek as the "Kingdom of Ourania" or in English as the "Kingdom of
Heaven") wearing a crown of thorns. Izates or Izas is his title which is
an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning 'lord'. He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image
source: The Alexander Mosaic, Huqoq, Israel.

![Fig.1.9](/images/SauromatesII.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.9. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus, who was the
son of Tiberius Julius Cotys (aka Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius
Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Emperor Nerva), great-grandson of
Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Does he look familiar? ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC
CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ in the above coin translates to "King of the Sauromatians".
Sauromates is a Greek rendering of 'Sarmatian', refering to the Scythian
tribe who came from the Pontic steppe. 'Saur' means 'lizard' or
'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'. Therefore, translated
literallly ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ means "King of the lizard people", or
"king of the reptile people". The Sarmatians were known for their use of
scale armor, and this is where the reference comes from.

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed
above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the 'Sons of Ptolemy'), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc. and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^9]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy X Alexander I/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesars life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^10],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^11], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

4 Flavian Dynasty \

Vespassian was also a great-grandson of Cleopatra and Mark Antony (King Herod). He was Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Vespasian was his title, not his name (Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pasius = Peace. 'Vespasian' = 'King Peace') [^12]. He was also 'Flavius Scaevinus' the conspirator who was involved in Nero's assassination. 

![Fig.
1.10](/images/Vespasian.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.10. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I

'Antonia Caenis' was Vespassians mistress who was his first cousin who was Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria. (Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo).

Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria aka Antonia Caenis's son was Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Josephus who was the Prefect (leader) of the
Praetorian Guard which made him arguably the most powerful man in the empire during Vespasian's reign.

Vespassian's son Titus was in a relationship with his aunt Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod, who was St. Veronica in the bible (Veronica is a transliteration of the Greek name Berenike meaning 'victory').

Bernice's brother Marcus Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an incestuous relationship with before moving on to her nephew, was the governor of all foreign Roman territories except Egypt (which was governed by Tiberius Julius Alexander) during the Flavian period..

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesars adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister). 

Endnotes (chapter 4)

(a) The symbol of the cross, Celtic cross/high cross/sun cross/solar
    wheel, et.al., which predate christianity by thousands of years
    (Callanish Stones. Wikipedia,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones)]), was a
    prominant symbol in ancient Europe. The circle is a sunwheel that
    together with the cross served as a sundial that had markings to
    track the time, date, and lunar and agricultural cycles. Also, in
    portable form it was a sundial clock and compass. Although not a
    religious symbol, as they were astronomical tools, every city in
    ancient Europe would have had a large cross raised at its center in
    the same way that every city today has a clock tower at it's center.
    So you can see how christianity spread throughout Europe, through
    subversion. Most Europeans must have thought that christianity was
    simply the same relgion that they were already worshiping, and
    because of widespread illiteracy at the time, they had no idea what
    garbage was inside the bible.

(b) Suetonius (Divus Julius 88) notes Caesar's comet or 'Julian Star'
    (or Sidus Iulium) rose during his funeral games, interpreted as his
    soul's ascent---eerily similar to Christ's resurrection narrative.

(c) Mithridates VI Eupator was a direct descendant of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285-246 BCE) married Arsinoe I, and they had a daughter, Berenice Syra. Berenice Syra married Antiochus II Theos, a Seleucid king, and they had a son, Seleucus II Callinicus. Seleucus II Callinicus (246-225 BCE) married Laodice II, and they had a daughter, Laodice III. Laodice III married Mithridates III of Pontus, and they had a son, Pharnaces I of Pontus. Pharnaces I of Pontus (190-155 BCE) married Nysa, and they had a son, Mithridates V of Pontus. Mithridates V of Pontus (150-120 BCE) married Laodice VI, and they had a son, Mithridates VI Eupator (120-63 BCE)). Some historians believe that Ptolemy II Philadelphus was Alexander the Great's biological son who was raised by Ptolemy I Soter. Statues of Alexander and Ptolemy II Philadelphus look strikingly like father and son. Ptolemy I Soter married Alexanders mistress Thaïs, and his other wife Berenice had the same name as Barsine who was another mistress of Alexander. Barsine and Berenice are different forms of the Persian name Barsina. The Persian name Roshanak is translated as Barsina, so the names Barsine and Berenice are both related to the Roxana, which was the name of Alexander's Persian wife. This would make Asander (whose name is an obvious reference to Alexander) and Dynamis Alexander's heirs.

5 Rome on the Bosphorus?

My research on the origins of Christianity takes me to the Bosphorus
river in classical Anatolia (Julius Caesar = Asander, King of Bosphorus,
and Cleopatra = Dynamis). This is incongruent to mainstream history.
However, there are a few revisionist authors such as Anatoly Fomenko and
Gunnar Heinsohn who make the claim that the Western Roman Empire is a
duplicate of the Eastern Roman Empire not the other way around and that
much of the history of the Western Roman Empire was conjured up by the
Church Fathers, Jesuits, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and medieval forgers,
either to retrofit history to align with the Bible, due to conflicts
between the Vatican and the Eastern Byzantine Church, or for profit.

The area of modern-day Istanbul was once called 'Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn'
('Kingdom of the Romans') and the people of that region called
themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans). Historians assume that region got it's
name after Roman colonization, but why? Every romance language based on
Latin underwent a linguistic evolution except Romanian, which is the
closest language to classical Latin. Could it be that the original
Romans hailed from Romania and then moved south to Anatolia? A
substantial part of Byzantine coinage from two millenia ago boasts
inscriptions in Latin and not in Greek, including the Asander of
Bosphorus coin in Fig. 1.1.

There is genetic and historical evidence proving the Rome on the
Bosphorus theory. Rome was founded by Italic tribes of "Indo-Europeans".
However, this is where academic definitions fail because those founders
of Rome were actually 85%+ Anatolian Early European Farmer (EAF). The
Etruscans who established Rome were invaders from Anatolia, and the
Carians who hailed from southwest Anatolia have a strong connection with
the settlement of Rome (Aquilla = Qos = god of Kos of Caria).

6 Julius Caesar was a Title 

Identifying Julius Caesar as Asander of Bosphorus necessitates a re-examination of his name. 

Galata in Classical Anatolia was settled by the Gauls. Galatia bordered
the Bosphorus, and Julius Caesar/Asander was king of this region. The
king of Galatia during this time was Asander's brother-in-law Amyntas of
Galatia who ruled an area that streched into India under the alias
Amyntas Nikator.

"Gaius" then can refer to Asander's connection to the Gallian (Gauls (Galli = Celt in Latin)) people or his ancestry in the region.

Ceasar's gentilice (surname) was Iulius. Iulius can refer to the ancient Celtic tribe known as the Iudii or Iudaei. "Ioulios" (ιούλιος) in Greek also means "descended from Jupiter" or "son of Jupiter". So, it is possible that the word "jew" comes from the Iudii or Iudaei.
 
Caesarus refered to a Celtic chieftain. For example, Caesorix was the leader of the Cimbri tribe during the Cimbrian War.

Gaius Julius Caesar was a title, and Gaius Julius Caesar could conceivably translate to: Chieftan of the Iudii or Iudaiei tribe from Galatia.

I(J)upiter was called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus).

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts who called themselves
Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who was
Pythagoras's teacher shows this. Iber was sometimes
rendered as Aber or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew
languages. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for
Ireland. The word Atlantis means 'The Island of Atlas'. The titan Atlas
was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the bearer
of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the
island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia,
the Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas
where the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.).

Abel and Cain are just a copy of Romulus and Remus. Judas Iscariot is a copy of Brutus. Genesis 4:5-31. Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah, Lamech, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, are copies of Titus Livy's Regal Rome of the seven kings.

Also, Caesar, Kaiser (German for Caesar), Kesar or Kaysar (Persian for Caesar), Kaisar (Ancient Greek for Caesar), Tsar (Russian for Caesar) and Khazar are not just phonetic coincidences. It all ties back to the Divine Julius cult.

So, it seems that the Romans (in Anatolia) tried to assimilate the tribe that became modern jews by forcing their imperial cult on them and they got their identity from here. This is why several prominant members of this royal family identified as "Jews" despite being Aryan Sarmatians and Celtic Galatians.

7 Esus the Celtic Deity

The Celts in classical Galatia worshiped a deity called Hesus/Esus/Iesus. The Celtic name Esus is believed to be related to the Proto-Celtic word "*aisu", which means "lord" or "master". The letter "J" was invented in the 17th century, so the name "Jesus" would have been "Esus" in the classical sense. 

The Romans used a system called 'interpretatio romana' to associate their gods with local ones as part of their colonial program.
Julius Caesar, as the claimed 'son of I(J)upiter' would have been Iupiter-Zeus to let the Greeks know that Iupiter
and Zeus were equivalent deities (Roman Jupiter and Greek Zeus both
derive from the Aryan skyfather 'Dyeus Pter'. The name Zeus comes from
the pronunciation of Dyeus, and Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of
"Dyeus Pter"). I(J)upiter-Zeus-> I-Zeus-> Izeus-> Esus. Did the name Esus come from here?

I-Zeus (Izeus)/Esus/Hesus then eventually phonetically shifted to I-zas/Izas/Izates.

![Fig.
1.11](/images/Esus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.11. Statue from classical Anatolia that is dedicated to "Esumopas Cnusticus". Esumopas means "Slave to Esus", and Esus means lord in proto-Celtic. If you combine the Etruscan word "cnus" with the suffix "-ticus" or "-tic-" you get a word that translates to "anointed one" or "consecrated one", ie. a "Christ". So, that inscription translates to: "Slave to Lord Christ".

8 Subversion of the Imperial Cult

Sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), a group of rabbis
that were headed by a rabbi named Akiva who lead the Talmudic Pharisees
and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer Yetzirah (book
of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and modern judaism,
and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle claimed that he was
brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)), and who
was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome was Edom", realized
that subversion was the only way to defeat the Romans. So, rabbi Akiva
and his students Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria
aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Simon ben Yohai (Justin Martyr?), Ketia bar
Shalom aka 'Clement of Rome' (hebrew Ketia is the same as Latin Clement), Aristo of Pella, who is a good candidate
for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or 'Ariston' is a name that is
related to 'Proteus' The former means 'first-rank, noble' the second
derives from 'first'. So, was he also Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or
Mahalia, sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem was the secretary of Aristo and
Marcion is known to have had a disciple named Lucanus as documented by
Tertullian, so Mark, or Mahalia, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was
also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope?) and Rabbi Meir aka Polycarp aka Bishop ignatius (Ignatius means firely one and Polycarp was famous for lighting himself on fire), added a slave-morality suicide cult to the imperial cult.

Many of rabbi Akiva's students and contemporaries had connections to the
Alexandrian School in Egypt and were themselves students of Philo of
Alexandria.

Rabbi Akiva was likely Paul the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 "Paul" claims to have been educated at the feet of Gamaliel who was the teacher of rabbi Akiva, and in Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul the Apostle and Paul called them “my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.

Quintus Tinnius Rufus (Turnus Rufus the Evil) was Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judaea who crucified Simon bar Kokhba and killed rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva preached that Simon bar Kokhba was the jewish messiah.

Esus then became Esau (Edom) the progenitor of the Edomites in the bible, a metaphor for the forces of oppression and injustice. This was probably added to repulse their fellow jews from following/converting to their slave-morality religion they created. 

Getting people to abandon their religons for a new one is an almost impossible task, so instead, through religious syncrenism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established
religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. So, they just took
one of the Bosphoran/Roman imperial cults of the time and infused a slave morality into
it. Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus or one of his successors in the Bosphoran imperial cult (King Izates Monobazus or Tiberius Julius Sauromates II) was replaced with Simon bar Kokhba. This became modern Christianity.

Endnotes (Chapter 8)

(a) Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria grew up in the Attis-Sabazios cult on Anatolia before traveling to Judea to study under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian School.

(b) Yohai is a nickname for yochai. The name Yochai means 'YHWAH is gracius' from the Hebrew word Yochanan sometimes transcribed as Johanan. Was he also Johanan the Alexandrian? This would place him in Alexandria at the same time as Markianos of Alexandria.

(c) Quintus Tineius Sacerdos, the brother of Quintus Tinnius Rufus, was the govenor of Pontus in Anatolia, so the family likely derived from there. Pilate means the temperament of a warrior I.e.: famously temperamental. That's where the name Pontius Pilate comes from.

(d) How did christianity spread? Vespasian and his sons Titus and Domitian
brought 100,000 jewish "slaves" to Rome (Josephus, Jewish War vi, 9)
[^13]. It seems likely that the 100,000 jewish "slaves" joined the jews
that were already in Rome and they became the early church missionaries
and profited from selling this religion to the slaves and exploited
classes.

    for a few authors who make the claim that the "first Rome" was based
    out of Anatolia. I subscribe to this theory as well. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. Also, the word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called "Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn" ("Kingdom of the Romans"), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the "new History" that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    --Sir Isaac Newton, in his book "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended" (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand. Anatoly Fomenko also makes several other controversial
    claims in his work, specifically that Charlemagne was not a real
    person, but one of the phantom individuals Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same person. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same
    person. The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic
    Plague (it's a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed
    "Dark Ages") is exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. The
    Trojan War and the Crusades were the same conflict. Also, that there
    were multiple "Romes" and the major one was based out of Anatolia,
    in an area that is modern Istanbul. The last point I independently
    confirmed. Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, and all early
    Christianity traces back to to the Bosphorus.

[^2]: Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to
    the Indo-Aryan word for "king" and Julius (Iulius) is similar to
    both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for "sun"). Julius Caesar
    was deified in two religions: in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is
    related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which
    made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (There was no letter J in
    Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both
    derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky
    Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and
    (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" ->
    Diespiter -> Iupiter), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus
    Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented,
    Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was
    put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high
    priest) in his religion.
    --A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca.
    47--17 BCE) refers to Asander/Asandros as Asandros Philoromaios
    Soter and gives him the title "King of Kings". So he was a
    "Soter"/Christ. Source: Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani (CIRB

[^5]: His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by
    Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod,
    Mithridates Chrestus descendant?) after Rome's defeat of Parthia
    around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant
    carried the title Monobazus aka Manu-Sabazios). The Mithras cult has
    many similarities to Christianity; Mithras was born of a virgin,
    Mithras' birth was celebrated on December 25, Mithras was considered
    a savior and redeemer, etc., although all these traits are "de jure"
    of saviors in ancient religions, probably because they all came from
    the "Alexandrian School" in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism,
    Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism,
    Mandaeism, and many other religions came from the Alexandrian
    School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint for these
    religions./

[^6]: Jesus ben Fabus who was Isa Amen (Jesus Amen) of Rev. iii. 14 who
    was also Amyntas (Amen(tas)) of Galatia who was also Amyntas Nikator
    (the name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben
    Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Persian "Bagus" means
    god. "Boga" in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona
    "Bog-" means god in Celtic. In Latin Nikator translates tro
    Invictus). His palace at Iśauria reveals his name as Iśa. (See:
    Jesus Christ Was Amyntas of Galatia (2010) by Ranajit Pal

[^7]: The name Herod likely derives from the amalgamation of Horus and
    Hercules (Herakles in Greek). Mark Antony claimed descent from
    Hercules and declared himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became
    king of judaea around the time of Mark Antony's "suicide". This is
    typical for these elites, they would kill off one character and then
    assume another one in a different location as if they were actors in
    a play
    --The Shekel of Tyre that King Herod minted depicts Mark Antony and
    an image of Hercules:
    https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels
    [[link](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels)].
    Herod also built a number of temples and shrines dedicated to
    Hercules, including one in Beirut and another in Tyre. He also
    depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. King Herod's son,
    Herod Antipas, has the same name as Mark Antony's son, Antyllus,
    King Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius, Mark Antony's
    son with Fulvia. The wife of Iullus Antonius is called Marcella
    daughter of Octavian/Augustus' sister Octavia. Fulvia and Antony
    also are said to have had two daughters, Antonia I and Antonia II.
    Caligula and Claudius were descendants of Antonia I. Probably
    Antonia I and/or II was the sister of Herod the Great called Salome.
    Probably there is also a connection between "Costabar" husband of
    Salome and the Roman "Ahenobarbus" who married Antonia I. --Mark
    Antony (King Herod) = Tiberius Claudius Nero. The way to make this
    connection is through the equivalence of Doris the first wife of
    Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
    Octavius/Caesar Augustus. Augustus was first married to Scribonia,
    but not happily. In 39 BC she gave birth to a daughter, Julia, but
    was divorced by Augustus. In the same year he became engaged to
    Livia Drusilla, who was at the time pregnant, not by Augustus but by
    her own first husband. That husband was Tiberius Claudius Nero,
    praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor
    of 62 BC. Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla's son was
    emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus.

[^8]: Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias was also King
    Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua
    Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy
    aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. (See: Jesus, King of Edessa (2012) by Ralph
    Ellis
    [[link](https://x.com/ralfellis/status/1809520320077803525)]).
    King Izates of Monobazus was married to the sister of Dynamis's
    mother. --Cleopatros in Hebrew is QLPTRS and was shortened on
    inscriptions to QTRS or Katros, later mistakenly recorded as
    Cantheras. So the Jews for derogatory reasons called it as Panthera.
