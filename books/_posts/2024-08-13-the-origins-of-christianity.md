**Epigraph**  

*And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died … And the Lord said unto Moses, make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.* - Numbers 21:9 (The "fiery serpents" in this passage are identified as Scythians in later analysis.)

**Introduction**
 
Christianity is a derivative of one of the religions that were invented at the Alexandrian School in Egypt. The Alexandrian School was a religion-making factory that was set up by Ptolemy Soter. The Serapis cult, Judaism, Gnosticism, Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mandaeism, and many other religions originated from there. 

All these religions were psychological and political tools that were created to target regional populations in the empire and were designed to subvert their regional religions in a syncretic manner, through the creation of centralized texts and priesthoods, embedding moral codes like submission, self-sacrifice, obedience, loyalty, and divine judgment, and aiming to lead the population toward monotheism and gradually toward a universal imperial cult. These religions were also likely designed to segment the populations by class, culture, and region to prevent unified resistance. For example, Mithraism was for military elites (requiring blood oaths, with a Mithraic initiate caste system and hierarchical structure). Serapism was for civilians (promising afterlife salvation). Christianity was for slaves ("turn the other cheek").

Christianity was created in phases, the first phase as a synthesis of the Serapis Cult rebranded to serve one of the later Roman (Bosphoran) imperial cults, then reworked by the Flavians, and finally this imperial cult was subverted by a group of Rabbis who were headed by a rabbi named Akiva sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt. Jesus in the bible was an avatar, or an administrative title originally for members of the Bosphoran royal family. Asander, king of Bosphorus (Julius Caesar's real identity) took on this role, so did his son Aspurgus, king of Bosphorus aka Amyntas ("Amon-Tas". "Hidden
Lord", linking to Amun-Ra - with "Amen"(tas) at the root) Nikator aka
Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen (Jesus was named
"Amen" in Rev. iii. 14) aka Caesarion, and his later descendants Izates II, king of Adiabene ("Iza" = Avestan root for "serpent" (cognate with Scythian Aži) + "-tes" = "given by," as in Mithradates = "Given by Mithra". This is cognate with the Scythian (and broader Iranian) mythological figure Aži Dahāka (Avestan) or Azhi Dahak (Middle Persian)), and Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, also took on the role. After Rabbi Akiva Jesus then became Simon Bar Kokhba.

It was necessary for these rabbis to cut and paste from an imperial cult, just as it was necessary for the Alexandrian School religions to be packaged as sects of local religions, because getting people to abandon their religions for a new one is an impossible task. However, there are thousands of sects of major religions today, many with different prophets.(The Alexandrian School and Library of Alexandria were founded soon after the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great failed to catch on, so it was likely at this at point when they began focusing on subverting established religions instead of forcing a new one on the population.)

This book traces Christianity back to its foundations — from the mythemes of Scythian snake-worshiping cults, to the Alexandrian School in Egypt and the Sarapis cult, to the Roman (Bosphoran) imperial cult — and then finishes with the subversion of the Bosphoran cult.

A few things you need to know before you read my book:

-   Much of what we know of ancient history is fabricated by the Flavian emperors, Jesuits, and the Vatican. The Egyptian-Persian-Indian-Greek-Roman elite were a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Elite (Kurgan Culture) who were the horse-riding, chariot-inventing pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe who, beginning around 4500 BC, began a systematic conquest of Europe, Anatolia, and the Indus Valley, and who ruled through proxy dynasties. Egypt, Persia, India, Greece, Rome,
etc., were all at one point under the suzerainty of Aryan Iranian-Scythian elites and their base of operation was on the Bosphorus river.
-   Western Rome in Italy is a phantom empire that was invented by the Vatican. Western Rome was built during the Renaissance period. The original Rome (in Sarmatian, "Ruma" (Rome) = "Place of the Dragon" (Rhu-Ma, from Aži Dahāka, the Iranian dragon)) was located on the Bosphorus river which approximates to modern-day Crimea in southern Ukraine.
-   Asander, king of Bosphorus aka Julius Caesar was also Ptolemy XI Alexander II, Cleopatra's uncle, but he took on numerous
other regional aliases. Cleopatra was also Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus. Mark
Antony the Neos-Dionysos was either Ptolemy of Cyprus, a brother of
Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII Auletes (Auletes name adapts well to the
Parthian Orodes (II?)) the Neos Dionysos aka Polemon (Polemos ->
Ptolemy) I of Pontus aka Pharnaces II ("Pharao-Nikes", or "Victorious Pharaoh") aka King Herod (Egyptian: Heru (Horus) + Ud
(divine) -> Herud -> "Herod") aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates
IV of Parthia (Per-aa or Per-Nesu is a corruption of Pharaoh), or he was
Ptolemy XII Auletes himself (Cleopatra's full name, Cleopatra VII
Philopator, derives from the Ancient Greek 'Φιλοπάτωρ' meaning "the one
who loves her father", or simply "father-loving"). She was also married
to two of her brothers and her uncle as listed previously. This is how
incestuous this family was.

This book directly challenges mainstream historiography. My methodologies are:
archaeological and numismatic evidence, linguistic and etymological
analysis, and historical correlation and timeline analysis. The sources
that inspired my work are listed in the 'Bibliography' section at the
end of the book.

**1 Name and Title Meanings**

-   Azhi: Azhi = Až ("serpent") + Hi ("power, divine") in Avestan, meaning "mighty dragon". It extends Aži to signify divine authority across Indo-Iranian and Scythian cultures. Azhi = Asia (Azhi-A) = "land of the mighty dragon" (Aži is cognate with the Chinese Zhī (dragon)), a very similar name to Rome (Rhu-Ma) = "Place of the Dragon", Romania (Rhu-Ma + Na) = "dragon land", and Sarmatia (serpent) + ma (mother, land). Aži links to Aesir (Norse gods), Asar (Egyptian Osiris), and Ahura (Zoroastrian god). The root Az-/As- means both "divine power" and "serpent" in Indo-European and Scythian languages (Sanskrit asura, Hittite hasu = king). Aži Dahāka in Avestan = Aži (serpent) + Dahāka (man) which translates to "Serpent-Man". 
-   Caesar: The Egyptian name "Asar" was another name for Osiris. "Ra"
    was the Egyptian deity of the Sun (Asar-Ra). Sar means king in Scythian. This title very likely
    connects to "Asar-Hapi" (Osiris-Apis), another name for the
    Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis (Osiris + Apis = Osorapis). The Etruscan
    word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar"), meaning god or
    divine, likely derives from the Egyptian Asar. The Greek language
    adds a "K" to foreign words, so Aesar -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin
    Caesar. This title also resembles the Scythian/Hurrian "Kur-Sar" (Sun King), the Phoenician "Kosar" (sun god), Assyrian "Aššur" (god), Germanic Æsir (the Norse gods, like Odin), Scythian "As" (lord) and Scythian Sar (king), Kšar (from the Old Persian Xšaya = king), and also Cyrus the Great's title (Kuruš (Cyrus) = Khur (Sun) + -uš (lord)).
-   Christ: Karast, a person who is anointed as a Heru (Hero/Horus) during their lifetime. When they are deceased they receive great honor as a KRST or Ausar (Osiris). Egyptian Karast (“Anointed One”) = Greek Christos (“Anointed One”) = Scythian Xšaθra (Power, Dominion, Kingdom which becomes "Kšatrapati" (Satrap, Governor) in Persian, and "Kshatriya" (Warrior-King) in Sanskrit, which also = Vedic "Krishna" = Hyksos "Khasut", linking India, Egypt, and Judea to a Scythian elite. Christ is identical to the title Soter. Several historical figures were
    Christs/Soters. In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus the Great "The
    Anointed One". Alexander the Great was also a Chréstos/Soter
    (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b). Up until the First
    Council of Nicaea the title "Christ", or "Christian", referred to the
    Serapis Cult ("those who worship Serapis are, in fact, Christians,
    and those who call themselves bishops of Christ are, in fact,
    devotees of Serapis.". Source: The Letter of Hadrian to Servianus).
-   Cotys: In Thracian, "Cotys" is related to the word "kotys", a title
    meaning "lord". In the Celtic languages the word "cottos" or
    "cottius" means "chieftain".
-   Flavius: Flavus = yellow/golden is a deliberate Latin mistranslation of the Scythian root Pālava or Palavi (Pahlavi), the term for the Parthian/Iranian aristocracy. The "Flavian" line was a Parthian/Sarmatian proxy dynasty installed by the Bosphoran center (Julius Caesar/Asander's line) to enforce the new Christianized Imperial Cult. They claimed a 'Golden Age' (Flavius) when they were truly the Pahlavi (Parthians) rewriting the Roman lie. 
-   Izates or Izas: "Iza" (𐬌𐬰𐬀) = Avestan root for "serpent" (cognate with Scythian Aži). "-tes" = Greek suffix, but possibly from dāta ("given by," as in Mithradates = "Given by Mithra"). This is cognate with the Scythian (and broader Iranian) mythological figure Aži Dahāka (Avestan) or Azhi Dahak (Middle Persian), a monstrous serpent or dragon.
-   Jesus [^1] : Yeshua derives from Aesus (Etruscan god) via Yazata (Divine Serpent-Lord), related to Izates (Yazata). In the name "Yeshua Ben Panthera" the Panthera is a Hellenized form of Ptolemaios (Ptolem->Ptol->Panther). "Jesus, son of Ptolemy". This directly connects the "Jesus" figure to the Ptolemaic-Bosphoran royal house.
-    Jew: Iudii -> Ioudaioi -> Jew. The Iudii, a Galatian tribe, were Scythian-Celtic priests who later became "Jews" under Alexandrian syncretism. Iudii is cognate with Iove (Jove) or Jupiter. Celtic Iudii then disappeared after the Bar Kokhba revolt when emperor Hadrian decimated their population. The term "Ashkenazi" (Scythian: Ashkuza) confirms their steppe origins, later demonized by Rabbi Akiva to erase their Sarmatian roots. 
  - Lord: The term Kavi in Avestan texts (e.g., Yasna 10.6) denotes a divine ruler associated with Aži (dragon/serpent). Translating Kavi to Greek yields Kyrios ("lord"), a title used for Jesus in the New Testament (e.g., Kyrios Iesous). The Scythian title Xšaya (king) appears in Old Persian as Xšayathiya, phonetically linked to Kshatriya (Sanskrit: warrior-king) and Caesar via the Greek Kaesar. A kurgan inscription from Issyk (Kazakhstan, 4th century BCE) mentions a ruler named Ašakavi ("dragon-priest"), combining Aša (truth/order) and Kavi. This title parallels Asander (Thracian: Asa = "lord") and suggests a pan-steppe naming convention for dragon-kings. 
-   Monobazus: Sabazios is the Phrygian and Thracian version of Zeus.
    Ma'nu is likely a diminutive of Menneus ("son of man"), and then
    Manu-Sabazios becomes Monobazus. Monobazus also becomes "Bazus" or
    "Bar Izates" shortened to "baYZTus" (or bar YZT) through frequent
    oral repetition which then becomes "bOETHus". The Boethusians were a
    jewish priestly sect.
-   Piso cognomen: "Appius" is a cognomen (personal name) of the
    Claudian family. Appius and Piso are synonymous (In Greek, Appius is
    rendered as Appios, from there Piso). The name Piso itself would be
    a form of Peisistratos/Pisistratos, the leading name of ancient
    Athens in Greece. (Pisistratos is a Latinized spelling of the Greek
    Peisistratos). It could be said that all the ruling elite of the
    Julio-Claudian dynasty were Pisos, including Nero who was nearly
    deposed by a Piso. Appius is also cognate with Arrius (through
    rhotacization in ancient Latin the /p/ and /r/ could be swapped).
-   Sar root:  Sar is the Scythian word for "king". Sarpa in Sanskrit means "serpent". Sarmatian, Akkadian Sarrum (which becomes Persian Xšaya-/Xšayathiya), Hurrian Šarri, Sargon, Sarlagab, Serapis (Sar-Apis = "Serpent Bull"), Zarathustra (Sar + Ustra = "serpent-lord"), Saraswati (Hindi goddes of knowledge), Saracen (Roman designation for Middle Eastern peoples), Šaruma (Mitanni deity), Saragurs (Scythian tribe in China), Caesar, Asar (Osiris), Tsar (Slavic monarch), Sargon of Akkad, feminine Sarai (or "Sarah" meaning "princess" (Genesis 17:15)), etc. Sar means king, or serpent king, across the empires that the Scythians used to rule over.
-   Vespasian: Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pas means "all" as in Pan. "Vespasian" = "King of All", or "King of Everything" which is a claim to the title "King of Kings"). Another option: Vas/Bas = King, and Pasian = Pisonian (a member of the key conspiratorial Piso family). King Piso

**2 Ancient Alias Names List (Chronologically Organized by Era and Dynasty)**

Note on aliases: I believe that the Ptolemaic elites in antiquity employed an incredible number of regional aliases, locations, fictional stories, faked adoptions, and fabricated deaths for themselves and their family members as a way to control the
population. They role-played as deities, religious figures, and various characters as if they were actors in a play. This was done partially for obscuration, but also because people wouldn't accept foreign kings or kings with foreign names, and also, for theological requirements: a god-king had to manifest in different regions according to local religious expectations. For example, the governor of Roman Egypt from 33 CE to 38, Aulus Avillius Flaccus, was also Polemon II of Pontus, who was
the prince of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, which was
the regional alias of Emperor Titus. The character of Aulus Avillius
Flaccus dies at the same time Polemon II of Pontus takes power, and then
Polemon II of Pontus dies around the same time Titus becomes emperor.
The way to connect them is through the fact that they were all married
to the same woman, Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod.

I. Ptolemaic, Julio-Claudian & Bosphoran Dynasty 

-   Julius Caesar: Ptolemy XI Alexander.
II, Asander, King of Bosphorus (Philocaesar Philoromaios, Soter, Great
King of Kings, "As" in his name refers to
Asar(Osiris)/Aesar/Aeser/Aisar/Ais/Is), Brogitarix. Other suspected aliases: Mithridates II of the Bosporus, Akrosandros II, King of Scythia, Idumean Antipater, Parthian Artavasdes (Greek Alex = Persian
    Arta) who was the brother of Tigranes II (Tigranes II/the Great was called Azhdahak proving Aži Dahāka was a royal Scythian title), and the Hasmonean
    Alexander II (son of king Aristobulus II son of Jannaeus Alexander
    also the nephew and son-in-law of king/high-priest Hyrcanus II.
    Also, Julius = Janneus? Or Janneus (Yannai) is related to the Roman
    name Gaius?).
-   Cleopatra VII (Isis who in mythology was the wife of Osiris and the
mother of Horus): Dynamis Ourania (Aphrodite Urania), Pythodorida
Philometor (Pytho- from python, and -doria from the Dorian tribe who were Scythian Greeks). Also, Amanirenas ("Amon is Lord"), Kandake of Kush?
-   Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt: Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus (his wives/sisters: Laodice (in Pontus) = Cleopatra V Tryphaena (in Egypt). The same woman), Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius = Mar (Phoenician "lord") +
Anton (from Antaeus, giant son of Gaia)), King Herod (Heru (Horus) + Ud (divine) = Herud -> Herod. "The Divine Horus". The "Slaughter of the Innocents" is a mythological trope attached to the birth of every Horus-figure who must overcome a threat (against Set). It is not history; it is theological propaganda asserting Herod's/Mark Antony's legitimacy as the living god-king against the resurrected one. This is also attached to the Indian god Krishna (against Kamsa)), Polemon (Polemos ->
Ptolemy) I of Pontus aka Pharnaces II ("Pharao-Nikes", or "Victorious Pharaoh"), Tiberius Claudius Nero, Phraates IV of Parthia (Per-aa or Per-Nesu is a corruption of Pharaoh). Was he also Ptolemy X Alexander I aka Simon Boethus aka Simon Magus?
-    Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus = Tiberius Julius Aspurgus, king of Bosphorus (Tiberius Julius Aspurgus, son of Asander and Dynamis, and Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar were born around the same time and their reigns are nearly perfectly co-terminus. Their sons were also born around the same time. Emperor Tiberius was first married to Vipsania Agrippina. The name Vipsania is obscure, but Agrippina means "wild horse" (from agri- "wild" and -pina "mare"), and Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios's wife, known only through numismatic evidence, was Gepae-pyris (Gepa- from hippos, "horse" in Greek, cf. Epona, Celtic horse goddess and -epyris (possibly "lady" or "queen"). Both names encode "Horse-Queen." This is a title for a Sarmatian noblewoman of the steppe horse-culture. Tiberius Julius Aspurgus and Gepaepyris had two sons; the eldest was "Tiberius Julius Mithridates Philo-Germanicus Philopatris" ("son of Mithra, lover of Germanicus, lover of father"). Their second son was "Tiberius Julius Cotys I Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes" ("lover of Caesar, lover of Rome who is the Pious One"). Now, let's connect this family to the Roman Emperor's family: Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar: Adopted son and heir: Germanicus. Biological son: Drusus. The name "Tiberius" likely refers to the Tibara, a tribe of the Pontic steppe also known as the "Tibarenoi")
-    Emperor Claudius = Rhoemetalces II (Reigns are nearly perfectly co-terminus. Polemon Pythodoros (Julius Caesar/Asander) and Pythodorida of
Pontus (Cleopatra/Dynamis) had a daughter Antonia Tryphaena. Her son was
Rhoemetalces II whose reign coincided with emperor Claudius)

II. Herodian & Flavian Dynasty

-   Alexander (son of Herod): Juba II.
-   Alexander (grandson of King Herod): (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
    (Alexander) bar Menneus, Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka Joseph Panthera,
    the name for jesus's father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption
    of Cantheras, or Cleopatros. Also, Panthera = Ptolemy in Hebrew),
    Tiberius Julius Alexander Major, Alexander the Alabarch.
-   Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania: Cleopatra IX, Helene,
    Drusilla of Mauretania, Julia Ourania of Parthia, Philo of
    Alexandria. She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary "Pallas", and
    "Antonia Caenis" who was Vespasian's first cousin and mistress (the full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas, with the Antonius part being an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony and that Pallas wasn’t a random slave. Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo).
-   Tiberius Julius Alexander: Emperor Nerva, Arrius Piso, Josephus.
-   Marcus Julius Alexander: Izates Monobazus ("Jesus Emmanuel"), Yeshua
    Cleopatros.

III. Flavian Emperors

-   Vespasian: Herod Agrippa I (See: The Royal Ancestry of Emperor
    Vespasian. Henry Davis,
    https://www.henryhdavis.com/theroyalancestryofemperorvespasian
    [[link](https://henrydavis-cc.medium.com/the-royal-ancestry-of-the-roman-emperor-vespasian-72e144335299)]),
    Flavius Scaevinus.
-   Titus: Polemon II, Aulus Avillius Flaccus, Marcus Julius Agrippa I(?).

IV. Speculative

-   Alexander the Great: Scythian prince who was the son of Ateas the Scythian aka Artaxerxes
    II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") and half-brother of Darius III ("Darab").
    In India he took the regional aliases of Chandragupta Maurya
    ("Chandragupta" = "Sander-Gupta" (Scythian "Sander" = Alexander. "Aleks" = Greekization of "Alakh" which means "not seen" or "unseen" in Sanskrit/Hindi. "Gupta" = Hidden). Greek sources (Megasthenes) refer to Chandragupta Maurya as "Sandrokottos" with the Sandro- deriving from Alexandros. "Aži-ander": Aži
    (Avestan "dragon") + Andros (Greek "man") = "Dragon-Man". Alaksandu
    of Wilusa, a Hittie king of Wilusa (Troy) (Alaksandu = Alak-San-Du
    (Hurrian: "Ruler-Dragon-Son")), who predates Alexander by 800 years,
    proves that the name Alexander was a Scythian title for kings.
    Aži-Sandar also = "Dragon King" in Mittani and Old Persian. He did not die in Babylon. He "became a god" by undergoing a ritual transformation in the ziggurat. He then re-emerged in the East with a new identity. Alexander's mother Olympias (Ol or ophis + Pias = "serpent queen"), who was a Scythian princess of the
    Molossian tribe, claimed to have been impregnated by the god Zeus
    Ammon disguised as a serpent. Alexander's fathers name Philip was a title (Philippos (Lover of Horses) is a direct Greek translation of the Scythian royal title Pharnavaz (Horse-Lord)). Alexander also married the Scythian princess Roxana. Alexanders campaign was not a conquest, it was a Scythian restoration. The Achaemenid Persians (Achaemenes is likely Akh-Manesh or "Spirit of Manu", linking to the Vedic sage-king) were a rival Scythian clan (the "Ariya" - Aryans). Alexander was re-establishing the older, purer Scythian hegemony of the Medes and the pre-Zoroastrian Mitanni.
-   Gautama Buddha (Egyptian: "Ba-Djehuti", or "Soul of Thoth"): Bardiya (Smerdis)/Gaumata (Cyrus the Great's son who was satrap (governor) of the Persian province of Bactria (modern day Afghanistan)).
-   Marcion of Sinope: Markianos of Alexandria. The association with Sinope came from Aquila of Sinope who was a disciple of Rabbi Akiva. Are the two the same? Probably.
-    Moses = Manes/Mannu-Kuras = Manu (Scythian Sage-King) = Menes (Egypt’s legendary founder). Also appears in "Monobazus" → “Manu Bazus” → Sarmatian-Mythological Sage King. The Iranian Manu is a legendary civilizer, and in India he becomes the first Lawgiver (the Manu Smriti = Scythian governance code). The biblical Moses defeats Pharaoh (actually Mitanni elite), parts waters with a serpent-staff—obvious encoding of dragon-kingship (Aži Dahāka). Moses takes on different masks: M enes – the first official Pharaoh (not real, a compilation of conquerors). Menes – the semi-mythical Median king, founder of the priest-class. Mannu-kuras – Proto-Mede, whose name becomes Cyrus. The name Kur-Ash = "Sun Man". The Exodus is not Judaic memory: it's a political memory of Mitanni-Scythian expulsion from Egypt after the religious revolution of Thutmose III → Horemheb wiped them out with a new priest-kingship in Amarna.
 -   Paul the Apostle = likely a composite character or an avatar/cipher. Two suspects for having taken on the character are: 1) Saulus ben Antipater who was the
    son of Antipater/Herod Antipas the Tetrarch, grandson of King Herod
    (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Chapter 9, section 211), and 2) Rabbi Akiva (whose students included: Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter (Shimon bar Yonah). The character
    Paul/Saul's life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story
    "Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor". Josephus in Antiquities of the
    Jews, Book XX (Ch 9.4) refers to Paul (Saulus) as related to Herod
    Agrippa.    -
 -   Pythagoras: Abaris the Hyperborean. The high priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi was called Pythia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia)\] who breathed serpent vapors (ethylene gas). Greek writers regarded the Hyperboreans as the mythical founders of Apollo's shrines at Delos and Delphi  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea#Hyperboreans_in_Delos \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea#Hyperboreans_in_Delos)\]. The name "Pythagoras" is derived from the Greek words "Pythios" (Πύθιος), meaning "of Pythia" or "belonging to the Pythia ("Pythoness"), and "Agoras" is a direct linguistic link to "Agaroi", the name of the Scythian snake-venom priesthood. Abaris was a Scythian and the Scythians worshiped snake deities. Pythia was probably Pythagoras' mother.

**3 The Sarmatian Dragon Cult**

The Hyperboreans were a real Bronze Age civilization in the Ural-Volga region of modern Russia who spread their culture southward via the Kurgan hypothesis (c. 4000 BCE). Their descendants were the Scythians. One offshot of the Scythians were a tribe called the Sarmatians (also called Sauromatians
("Saur" = "Lizard/Dragon" + "Matae" = "Men/Warriors" - where the
Sumerian "sar" (king) comes from) who were a nomadic Indo-Iranian warrior
elite from the Pontic steppe (modern Ukraine/Russia). The domestication
of the horse and invention of the chariot allowed them to travel vast
distances and they spread their Draco (dragon/serpent) cult across Eurasia, encoded in snake-worshiping myths [^2] 

The Aryan-Iranian-Scythians were the Egyptian-Persian-Indian-Greek-Roman elite. Egypt, Persia, India, Greece, Rome, etc., were all under the suzerainty of these elites since at least the 40th century BC and their base of operation was on the Bosphorus river.

In the elite burial chambers from the Scythian Kurgans in Ukraine to the Etruscan tombs in Italy to the burial sites of Roman Patricians a specific non-local skull type appears: Dolichocephalic (long-headed) and high-vaulted with a pronounced occipital bun—a bulge at the back of the skull—a feature most commonly associated with Neanderthal admixture. This was no mere coincidence; it was the osteological signature of the Dragon Bloodline, a physiological marker distinguishing the ruling elite from the general population they governed.

All ancient Mediterranean religions derive from the
Sarmatian serpent-dragon cult. See: Papaios and the Snake-Legged Goddess (Scythian) = Nehebkau, Uraeus, and Apep/Apophis (Egypt) = Ningishzida (Sumerian) = Tiamat and Mušḫuššu who was associated with Marduk (Babylonian) = Aži Dahāka (Zoroastrianism) later syncretized with Mithra = Ophion, Agathodaemon, Typhon, and Delphi's Pythoness priestess (Greek) = Nāgendra and Nāga (Vedic), Nehushtan/serpent staff of Moses, the Dacian and Roman Draco standards, the serpent-worshipping Essenes and Gnostics, Sebazi (Phrygian/Bulgarian), Jörmungandr (Norse), Ouroboros serpent in Freemasonry, etc. The Knights Templar knew the truth. The Templars worshipped Baphomet—a Sarmatian dragon deity (Aži Dahāka).

Kings who took on the snake/dragon/serpent/Azhi Dahaka title: Scorpion I, Pharaoh of Egypt, Azhdahak, which is the Armenian form of the name of the Avestan Azhi Dahaka, was associated with the Median king Astyages (564–550 BC) who was the grandfather of Cyrus the Great. Tigranes II/the Great, King of Armenia (140–55 BC) was also called Azhdahak. Izates II, king of Adiabene's title Iza" = Avestan root for "serpent" (cognate with Scythian Aži), Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus ('Saur'
means 'lizard' or 'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'). The roots of the snake titles were: Aži-, Azhd-, -zates, Sauro-, Draco-.

The snake was revered by the Scythians for several reasons: apart from symbolism, the Sarmatians used armor that resembled snake skin, the Scythian priesthood called the Agaroi created poisons called "scythicon" from snake venom that they used on their arrows, and snake venom was used as painkillers and stimulants before war. Snake venom was also used to stop battlefield wounds from bleeding, as well as, they were used as anecdotes, as later emulated by figures such as Mithridates of Pontus who daily consumed a potion called "Mithridatium" which was claimed to make people invincible. Also, the foundation myth of the Scythians is that they were created from the Snake-Legged Goddess who was impregnated by Hercules (Targiatos).

-The Etruscan Tarquin dynasty (616 BC) - Scythian rulers of Rome. Tarquin = Tarkhu (Scythian: "Ruler"). Servius Tullius = Tulli (Scythian: "Wolf Clan").\
-The Alani (100 BC - 450 AD) - the purest, highest-ranking Scythian tribe. They are the core of the Sarmatian confederation whose royal house ultimately produced the Julio-Claudians (Julius Caesar/Asander) (interesting fact: legendary King Arthur is a corrupted memory of an Alani Warlord (Artorius), one of the military Kšatrapatis sent from the Bosphorus to secure the lucrative tin and iron mines of Britain after the Flavian consolidation).\
-The Khazars (600 AD to 950 AD) - "Ashkenaz" people who controlled the Eurasian trade routes. The Ashkenazi Jews are the Scythian managerial class who maintained the forged chronology and trade networks for the Bosphoran heirs. Their state conversion to Judaism was a geopolitical alignment with the Calami (Jewish) financial proxies to solidify control over Eurasian gold and slave routes.

The Mitanni exercised hegemony over a pan-Eurasian empire. The Hittites,
also known as the Neshians, were one enforcement arm for the Mitanni.
They ruled by military dominance (chariots, cavalry, mercenaries),
installing puppet kings (often their own bloodline), controlling trade
routes (Silk Road, Black Sea, Pontic Steppe), and through enforcing
religious syncretism.

The eruption of Thera (Santorini) around 1600 BCE triggered a volcanic
winter that was recorded all the way in China. This destroyed the
ancient economy and caused continual strife and this was one of the
causes of the eventual collapse of the Bronze Age and the fragmentation
of Scythian hegemony. It also led to the Hyksos expulsion from Egypt and
Assyria rising up under the Chaldean priests (the Kalani, the Jews).
Jews referred to them as Ashkenaz, meaning Scythian (Josephus. Vol. 5:
Antiquities: 8:2:5, pp. 593-595). Khazaria is the former territory of
the Scythians, which is why they they were called Ashkenazi.

The Sea Peoples were the revenge against Babylon, Hittites, and Egypt
after the Mitanni were exiled.

The Sea people consisted of: The Sherden = The Sardinians = The Sauromatians (Sarmatians). The Peleset = The Philistines = The Pelasgians (pre-Greek people) = The Plataeans? This group represents Aegean Scythian remnants. The Denyen = The Danaoi (Homer's term for Greeks) = The Tribe of Dan (Israelites). The Israelite tribe of Dan was a seafaring tribe (see the Song of Deborah). They were not Semites; they were Scythian-Greek sailors who were later written into the Jewish narrative. Their migration from the coast to the north is a memory of their settlement after the Sea Peoples' campaigns.

The Hyksos descendants then re-emerged in Persia and Anatolia, later
reclaiming Egypt under the Achaemenid Period (525 BCE).

![Fig.1.1](/images/SauromatesII.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.1 Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. Does he look
familiar? ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ in the above coin translates to "King of
the Sauromatians". Sauromates is a Greek rendering of 'Sarmatian',
referring to the Scythian tribe who came from the Pontic steppe. 'Saur'
means 'lizard' or 'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'.
Therefore, translated literally ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ means "King of the
lizard people", or "king of the dragon people".

![Fig.1.2](/images/Tamga.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.2 The royal Tamga (symbol/signature) of Tiberius Julius Sauromates II contains a cross and a Chi Rho.

Ramesses II = "Ra-Mesu" (Scythian for "Born of the Sun Stallion"). "Ra"
= Egyptian sun god (syncretized with Scythian Mithra). "Mesu" = "Mares"
(horse in Scythian, symbol of kingship). Full meaning: "Sun Stallion's
Son".

Cyrus the Great = "Kurush" (Scythian for "Sun King"). The name "Cyrus"
(Old Persian: Kuruš) derives from Scythian "Khur" (Sun) + "Us" (Lord) =
"Sun Lord" (identical to Mitra/Mithra, the Indo-Iranian sun god). In
Avestan (Scythian religious texts), "Kavi" means "King-Priest". Cyrus'
clan was the "Kayanian" dynasty (Scythian royal bloodline).

Darius I = "Dārayavahuš" which was Scythian for "Holding the Horse" (a
Scythian warlord title). Darius' father was Hystaspes (Vištāspa)---which
means "Horse Tamer" in Scythian.

Xerxes = "Xšaya-ṛšā" (Scythian for "Hero-King"). "Xšaya" = "Kshatriya"
(warrior caste in Indo-Aryan). "Ṛšā" = "Aršan" (hero, male ruler in
Scythian). Full meaning: "Warrior-Hero King".

Sargon of Akkad = "Sharru-Kin" (Scythian for "True King of the Bow").
"Sharru" = "Xšaya" (king in Scythian, same as Xerxes). "Kin" = "Kaman"
(bow in Scythian, referring to horse archers). Full meaning: "King of
the Bowmen."

The Ptolemaic Egyptians (Ptolemaios - the root "ptol" resembling the
Indo-Iranian term for warrior-kings (e.g., Parthian pat, "lord"), or
Scythian Patala (horse lords), were the continuation of this bloodline.

The cross was not made of wood. It was a T-shaped standard, the Tau (Τ), the ancient symbol of the Mesopotamian god Tammuz of Ezekiel 8:14 who was associated with snakes. This was the crux commissa or Tau cross.

In Sarmatian, "Ruma" (Rome) = "Place of the Dragon" (Rhu-Ma, from Aži
Dahāka, the Iranian dragon).

Footnotes (Chapter 3)

(a) The eruption of Thera (Santorini) was one factor in destroying the
    Scythian steppe warriors hegemony, but the biggest cause was a
    cannabis cult that stripped them of their martial spirit
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enaree). Marijuanna turned them from
    fearless warriors into potheads who were led by transgender priests.\
(b) Azhdahak, which is the Armenian form of the name of the Avestan Azhi Dahaka, was associated with the Median king Astyages (r. 564–550 BC) who was the grandfather of Cyrus the Great. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azhdahak_(mythology)   
(c) Quetzalcōātl, the Mesoamerican serpent deity, shares uncanny similarities to Aži Dahāka which suggests a transoceanic exchange of religious ideas long before Columbus (the Jade Mask of Calakmul (7th century CE) also depicts a Caucasian-featured ruler with a serpent headdress—resembling Scythian dragon crowns).

**4 The Alexandrian School**

In Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter, who was a Scythian continuation of the Sarmatian snake/serpent kings line, used religion to subjugate the vast and disparate peoples he ruled. This was likely inspired by Plato's noble lie which is a concept from his work "The Republic" where he suggests that a myth or falsehood can be used by rulers to maintain social order and promote the common good. The Alexandrian School (Mouseion of Alexandria) then became his religion making factory. He was in the process of creating a universal religion and this was being achieved by gradual syncretism using local identities and blending local deities into syncretic universal savior archetypes (Interpretatio Graecae) as a transitional phase toward a universal monotheism. The Ptolemaic elites were conditioning the disparate populations they ruled into accepting the Serapis cult (sarp- is a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "serpent" as seen in Sanskrit sarpa, "snake". "Sar-Ap" translates to "Serpent-Lord" in Scythian).

![Fig.1.3](/images/SarapisAmunAgathodaemon.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.3 Copper statuette of the god Sarapis Amun Agathodaemon depicted as half-deity. half-snake (Egypt late Hellenistic/early Roman period 1st century BC - 1st century AD).

The Sarapis Cult eventually evolved into Christianity, which was repackaged Serapis cult and targeted at local populations (the Christogram symbolizing Jesus Christ (IHS) = "Isis-Horus-Serapis"). Religion was the technology that the empire used to subjugate the people they ruled.

**4.1 The Blueprint Deities: Pre-existing Saviors (Horus, Dionysus, Mithras, etc.)**

The Jesus archetype, as presented in Christianity, and characterized as a divine birth, a role as a savior or king, betrayal, sacrifice (often by crucifixion or a similar act), and resurrection is not a unique historical phenomenon but a syncretic construct, drawing from a recurring pattern of divine or semi-divine figures across ancient Indo-European, Scythian, and Near Eastern mythologies. The Alexandrian School did not invent these tropes; they identified and weaponized them. This section examines the 'blueprint deities'—Horus, Dionysus, Mithras, and others—whose myths provided the raw material for the School's religious engineering.

Romulus the Roman Deity

Rhu/Ru: The Indo-European root for "Dragon/Serpent" (cognate with the Scythian Aži). Ma: The Scythian word for "Place/Land" (as in the true Rhu-Ma on the Bosphorus). Romulus is the Aži Dahāka (Dragon) King who founds the city, establishing the legal right to rule.

According to Plutarch’s Life of Romulus (circa 75 CE) the Roman deity of Quirinus aka Romulus was born to a virgin, Rhea Silvia, impregnated by the god Mars, establishing his divine lineage. Hailed as a king and revered as the son of a god, Romulus founded Rome after a fratricidal conflict with his brother Remus, a narrative echoing the biblical Cain and Abel, crucified by a conniving elite and rose from the dead as the god Quirinus.

![Fig.1.4](/images/Denarius_C._Memmius_C._F._Romulus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.4. Romulus. 

Osiris the Egyptian Deity

Osiris's Egyptian Name is Asar or Wsir. The name "Asar" is the root. When the Greeks encountered him, they Hellenized it to Osiris. Osiris's Asar -> (Greek addition of the sacred 'I' prefix, I-Asar) -> Iasar -> Iēsous. His title: Neb-er-djer (Nb-ꜥr-ḏr) is often translated as "Lord of the Entire Universe." The key element is Neb (Lord).

After being betrayed and murdered by his brother Set, Isis and Nephthys ressurect Osirus.

Osirus was also a Christ. In Egyptian mythology a Karast is a person who is anointed as a Heru (Hero/Horus) during their lifetime. When they are deceased they receive great honor as a KRST or Ausar (Osiris). Egyptian Karast (“Anointed One”) = Greek Christos ("Anointed One").

Serapis the Greco-Egyptian Deity

Serapis, crafted under Ptolemy I at the Alexandrian School, fused Osiris’ resurrection with Apis’ strength, embodying the Jesus archetype through divine creation, salvation, and rebirth. Declared a god, Serapis mirrors Jesus’ divine sonship (Matthew 1:18–25), with his name (“Ser” = son) tying to “Aesar” (divine) and Scythian dragon-kings (Chapter 3). As a savior, he offered healing and afterlife promises, like Jesus (John 3:16), with serpent imagery (Fig. 1.3) reflecting Aži Dahāka. Osiris’ death-rebirth cycle parallels Jesus’ crucifixion-resurrection (Mark 15–16), and the Serapis cult’s destruction by Theophilus I (391 CE) echoes Judas’ betrayal. 

Up until the First Council of Nicaea the title "Christ", or "Christian", referred to the Serapis Cult ("those who worship Serapis are, in fact, Christians, and those who call themselves bishops of Christ are, in fact, devotees of Serapis.". Source: The Letter of Hadrian to Servianus).

Mithras the Iranian Deity

Mithras, a solar god shaped by the Alexandrian School for Roman military elites, parallels the Jesus archetype through divine birth, cosmic salvation, and sacrificial renewal. Born from a rock, Mithras mirrors Jesus’ virgin birth, while his tauroctony (bull-slaying) symbolizes redemption, akin to Jesus’ crucifixion (Mark 15:24). His cult’s suppression by Christian emperors reflects Jesus’ betrayal, and serpent imagery in Mithraic reliefs (CIMRM 593) ties to Scythian sun-god motifs (Chapter 3). Offering salvation through rituals like communal meals, Mithras prefigures Christian sacraments, supporting the manuscript’s claim that Christianity adapted Mithraism’s framework, redirecting its appeal from soldiers to slaves under a monotheistic imperial cult.

Horus the Egyptian Deity

Horus, the Egyptian god of kingship and son of Osiris, embodies the Jesus archetype through miraculous birth, divine victory, and resurrection, shaped by Alexandrian syncretism. Born to Isis after Osiris’ death, Horus parallels Jesus’ virgin birth (Matthew 1:18–25). As a savior, he defeated Set, akin to Jesus’ triumph over evil, with the Uraeus serpent linking to Scythian motifs (Fig. 1.6). His eye, torn out and restored, mirrors Jesus’ sacrificial death and resurrection (Mark 15–16), while Set’s betrayal of Osiris echoes Judas’ role. Tied to Cleopatra as Isis (Chapter 5), Horus’ royal-divine status supports Christianity’s adaptation of Egyptian theology for imperial unity.

Dionysus the Greek Deity

Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and resurrection, syncretized with Osiris by the Alexandrian School, mirrors the Jesus archetype through divine birth, liberation, and rebirth. Born to Zeus and a mortal, Dionysus parallels Jesus’ divine-human parentage (Matthew 1:18–25). His ecstatic rites and wine symbolism, akin to Jesus’ sacraments (John 2:1–11), offered spiritual freedom, while his death by Titans and resurrection echo Jesus’ crucifixion-resurrection. Betrayed by Pentheus (Bacchae), Dionysus ties to Mark Antony as Neos-Dionysos (Chapter 5), with serpent imagery (Orphic Hymns) linking to Aži Dahāka. His cult’s universal appeal prefigures Christianity’s monotheistic framework. The entire Jesus-as-Wine theme (turning water into wine, the Last Supper) is a direct usurpation and theological correction of the Dionysian cult by the Flavian chronographers. It established the Proto-Christ as the new, superior ecstatic wine-lord who demanded controlled, spiritual frenzy, not chaotic, physical frenzy.

Attis the Phrygian Deity

Attis, the Phrygian god of vegetation tied to Cybele, reflects the Jesus archetype through virgin birth, sacrificial death, and resurrection, adapted by Hellenistic cults. Born to virgin Nana on December 25 (Ovid, Fasti 4), Attis mirrors Jesus’ nativity (Matthew 1:18–25). His self-castration under a pine tree, a crucifixion-like act, and resurrection after three days (Pausanias 7.17) parallel Jesus’ sacrifice and rebirth (Mark 15–16). Betrayed by Cybele’s jealousy, Attis’ cult, linked to Sabazios (Chapter 5), features serpent motifs, aligning with Scythian dragon symbolism. Attis’ rites, emphasizing renewal, prefigure Christianity’s imperial adaptation for mass devotion.

Esus the Celtic Deity

The Celts in classical Galatia worshiped a deity called
Aesus/Esus/Iesus. The Celtic name Esus is believed to be related to the
Proto-Celtic word "aisu", which means "lord" or "master". The letter "J"
was invented in the 17th century, so the name "Jesus" would have been
"Esus" in the classical sense.

![Fig.
1.5](/images/Esus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.5. Statue from classical Anatolia that is dedicated to "Esumopas
Cnusticus". Esumopas means "Slave to Esus", and Esus means lord in
Proto-Celtic. If you combine the Etruscan word "cnus" with the suffix
"-ticus" or "-tic-" you get a word that translates to "anointed one" or
"consecrated one", ie. a "Christ". So, that inscription translates to:
"Slave to Lord (Esus) Christ". The "VSLM" inscription is an abbreviation
for the Latin phrase "Votum Solvit Libens Merito" which translates to
"He pays his vow willingly and with merit" or "He fulfills his vow with
pleasure and deserving", which is often found on Roman coins and other
artifacts. Esus was crucified in mythology and his symbol was an axe, so
he was associated with woodcutting, forestry, carpentry. Esus was also
part of a "trinity" of Gaulish gods that included Taranis, Teutates and
Esus.

The Esus cult was probably created to subvert the Druid Celts in
Galatia. It has all the fingerprints of the Alexandrian School:
year-zero (calendar starts at the deities birth), crucified diety
(self-sacrifice/self-annihilation as the highest virtue), afterlife
submission, etc. The fact it resembles Christianity is because it
follows the same framework that all the other Alexandrian School
religions do.

**4.2 Judaism** 

Ptolemy I Soter was also responsible for inventing Judaism. His aim was to subvert Canaanite identity once and for all, destroying the only contestant to Greco-Egyptian power in the world up to that point, and gradually forcing jews to accept the Serapis cult. 

It was in Alexandria at the Library of Alexandria where the Pentateuch and Septuagint were written. The myth of the jewish people and the Laws of Moses were based on Plato's hypothetical colony of Magnesia from his thesis called "The Laws" (347 BC) in which the proposed charter for the Cretan colony of Magnesia was modeled in large part on Athenian legal and constitutional traditions. Ancestor received law from a deity, hereditary priesthood rather than king, as well as the division into 12 tribes were all part of the formula. Plato's Timaeus (360 BC) is where the story of Abraham comes from. Plato's Timaeus is also the source for Genesis 1-11 15. Homer's Odysseey was the source of Genesis 24, 42-46. The biblical concept of hell was stolen from Plato's Replublic ('Myth of Er'), and the spiritual plane of Heaven is ripped off from Plato's 'World of Forms'. Exodus is just a semitized retcon of Jason and the Argonauts, and the Oracles Against the Nations plagiarize the Sibylline Oracles.

Moses = Manes/Mannu-Kuras = Manu (Scythian Sage-King) = Menes (Egypt’s legendary founder), but this name/title was reappropriated for the Sarapis Cult as Moses = Osarseph (Osar (Osiris) and seph (son) = Son of Osirus). The Greek rendering of Moses and Osarseph is identical. Osarseph appears in accounts by the Egyptian priest Manetho, who described him as a renegade priest leading a group of lepers in rebellion, eventually adopting the name "Moses" (Josephus. 'Against Apion' discussing Manetho's account of Osarseph). Osarseph also = Serapis. The "Ser" symbol in Ser-apis is the same as seph meaning "son of". Serapis can be interpreted as "Son of Osiris-Apis", which evolved into "Son of Osiris". So, Serapis is just another word for Osarseph. Solomon = Sol-Amūn or "Sun of Amun" which is a direct parallel to "Zeus-Ammon", a title for Alexander the Great. Abraham (Brahmin > Ibrahim > Abraham. A(Braha)m(in)) = Ab-Ram, or Son of Ram, or "Father Brahma". Alexander was the Ram god (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_of_Alexander), he was also Chandragupta Maurya in India.

The original redhead clan of Druids that ended up becoming Israelites were Celtic Scythians who migrated southward during the early Aryan invasion of 4000 BC. Scythian --> Saka --> Isaac. This migration coincides with the development of early Bronze Age civilization. They went to Anatolia first (Galatia), then Babylon, then Canaan ('Gaulinitis' = Golan Heights). In Canaan, the natives then came under the suzerainty of these Celts and their entire identity, language, and religion derives from this. The evidence for this is paternal DNA assays (Galatian Celts carried the Celtic R1b haplotype (10% of Ashkenazi jews), but also R1a, G2a, J2a, which are other paternal lineages that make up the bulk of jews paternal haplotypes), the fact that the Celtic languages are surprisingly Semitic with a verb-subject-object word order and a shocking amount of vocabulary overlap, and the name of Irish deities, Balor and his holiday Beltaine are cognate to Bal and Elatha the Irish Uranus is cognate to Hebrew El. King David (DWD) = King Druid. 1 Samuel 16:12 claims that King David had red hair. As for the name 'jew', the descriptive name Judaism was never used by the Hebrews or Israelites; it appears only with Christianity. It comes from Yahud or Auda which comes from Iodh or Ioux. Iodh and Ioux are associated with the yew tree in Druidism and are sometimes linked to the concept of rebirth and regeneration. The ancient Celtic prefixes 'Rab' or 'Rhab' mean 'wise one' or 'seer', and a Druid equates to a Rabbi.

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts as well who called themselves Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who was Pythagoras's teacher, who was the son of Seuthes (Seth), shows this. The term Abaris was inspired by the Semitic Iber. Iber was sometimes rendered as Aber or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew language. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for Ireland. The word Atlantis means ‘The Island of Atlas’. The titan Atlas was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the  bearer of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia, the Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas where the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.). Dionysius of Alexandria in Egypt (ca. 190-264 CE) also referred to the inhabitants of Britain as Iberi.

'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the ancient Akkadians. The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri, known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks. Cimmerians were a Middle Eastern offshoot of the Celtic Cimbri tribe. 

Jerusalem = I(J)ERU-SAR-AM, meaning "The Holy City of the Scythian King". The SAR element (Scythian for king/royal) embedded in the name of the 'holy city' confirms the Judean state, like Rome, was nothing more than a military garrison run by the Bosphoran elite.

These Sarmatian-Celtic (Galatian) males mixed with Neolithic Anatolian women before their descendants moved into Egypt (Apiru or Habiru) and Caanan and then mixed with indigenous people in those places. Celtic Jews (Iudii) then disappeared after the Bar Kokhba Revolt when Emperor Hadrian decimated their population. Modern Ashkenazi Jews are a hodgepodge of native Canaanites (a mix of Canaanites, Edomites, and other Levantine peoples, as well as, proto-Arab Natufians (Natufians had ~20% higher Basal Eurasian -- Basal means with sub-Saharin African, North Africa was green/fertile so Africans could cross the Sahara)) and Neolithic proto-Sicilians who originated in Anatolia [^4] with minor Celtic Cimbri and Celtic Galatian from Anatolia.

The rest of the jewish religion and identity came from later incarnations of this imperial cult: I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the Hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus).

Abel and Cain are just a copy of Romulus and Remus. Judas Iscariot is a copy of Brutus. Genesis 4:5-31. Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah, Lamech, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, are copies of Titus Livy's Regal Rome of the seven kings.

After the Serapis cult the Alexandrian School made an industry out of taking existing religions and then adding to them a psy-op slave-morality foundation. The goal was to get the population to accept monotheism and move them towards the Sarapis Cult. The Serapis Cult, Gnosticism, Mithraism, Christianity, Manichaeanism, Valentinianism, Hermeticism (Philo of Alexandria’s syncretic philosophy to Hellenize the Canaanite religion of the levant), Buddhism (Pyrrho of Elis's syncretic attempt at subverting the Indo-Aryans in Bactria which was governed by Gaumata Bardya, Cyrus the Greats son), etc., all came from here. 

Footnotes (Chapter 4)

(a) The director of the Mouseion and the chief architect of the synthetic religions was not a man. It was a succession of Ptolemaic princesses who held the title The Muse Ourania (The Heavenly Muse). The Mouseion was named after her office. Arsinoë II Philadelphus (c. 316 BC – 270 BC), daughter of Ptolmy Soter, was refered to as "the tenth Muse" and she had a cult dedicated to her as Arsinoë Aphrodite Ourania.

**5 Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus**

There was a Bosphoran [^5] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^6] took
on the role of Asander (also Asandros), King of Bosphorus [^7] ("Asa"
means "lord" in Thracian and serpent in Scythian (Scythian Assaioi: As-saioi = As is Scythian for "Serpent Lord", and Sai refers to clan/tribe. Sar means king in Scythian), and "andros" means "man" or "son of
man" in Greek. Jesus is referred to as "the son of man" 81 times in the
four canonical gospels. Asandros can also be interpreted as either "Dragon Man" (the same as Aži-ander, or Alexander), or "son of the
lord", or "son of Asa, the lord". The Thracian version of Zeus was Asa,
the Celtic was Esus/Hesus (Esus becomes Aesus, pronounced ah-soos. There
was no J in ancient Latin, so Jesus was pronounced ah-soos as well). The
Etruscan word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar" which likely
derives from the Egyptian "Asar" which was another name for Osiris),
from which Asa may also derive, means "god" or "divine". Asandros can
also possibly translate to either "son of god", or "son of Lord Aesar/Asar
(Osiris)". The Greek language often added the prefix "K" to words
borrowed from other languages, so Aesar ("god") -> Greek Kaesar ->
Latin Caesar. Cleopatra used the regional alias of Dynamis Ourania [^8]
(translating to 'heavenly power'), queen of the Bosporus. Cimmerian
Bosporus approximates to modern-day Crimea in southern Ukraine (see
also: Jesus Christ Was Born in Crimea by Anatoly Fomenko).

that is visible in the Julius Caesar coin above (https://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/coins/1/1845). The crescent moon and

Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She

son) Polemon II, King of Pontus aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka
Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of the
Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next to the Pontus Kingdom

The star and crescent on the above coins was the symbol of the city of Byzantium/Constantinople long before the Ottomans used it. The legend was that Byzas, the founder, chose the site based on a vision of a crescent moon and a star. This symbol represented the fusion of the lunar goddess (Hecate/Artemis, who was associated with snakes) and the solar god (Apollo). By using this symbol, Asander and Caesar were not just using a "dragon symbol"; they were explicitly claiming lordship over the Bosphorus.
 
 Asander was born in 110 BCE, the same year as Julius Caesar. Dynamis was
born in 70/69 BCE, the same year as Cleopatra VII. Julius Caesar was 30
years older than Cleopatra, and Asander was also 30 years older than
Dynamis.

A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17
BCE), refers to Asander as the "Great King of Kings Asandros
Philoromaios Soter" (Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani 30). So, he
was a 'King of Kings', Soter (savior), and 'The Great'. Individually,
each of those titles carries significance, but the 'Great King of Kings'
title in that inscription stands out because it is a rare title that was
used by Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great, so this shows Asander's
level of prestige and power to be placed alongside those two. Julius
Caesar is the only historical figure who had a comparable level of
prestige as Cyrus and Alexander.

Dynamis's father was Mithridates VI Eupator who also carried the title
"King of Kings". Her uncle was Mithridates "Chrestus" [^9]. The name
Mithridates (more accurately, Mithradates) is the Hellenized form of the
Indo-Aryan Mithra-Datt, meaning "One given by Mithra". Mithra is the
Indo-Aryan sun-god and Datt ("given by") derives from the
Proto-Indo-European root da ("to give"). That name was born by a large
number of kings, soldiers and statesmen in the Iranian dynasty of the
Parthians and mostly by the royalty and nobility in Asia Minor.

Mithridates VI Eupator beat his brother Mithridates Chrestus in war to
become king of Pontus/Bosphorus. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the
city is founded as the result of a fratricide, with the twins Romulus
and Remus quarreling over who has the favor of the gods and over each
other's plans to build Rome, with Romulus becoming Rome's first king and
namesake after killing his brother (mirroring the biblical account of
Cain and Abel).

Mithridates VI, king of Pontus, was the father of both Pharnaces II and
Dynamis (Cleopatra). Pharnaces II was Ptolemy XIV who was Cleopatra's
brother-husband.

Asander beat Mithridates Chrestus (his uncle) in battle to become King
of Bosphorus. After Mithridates Chrestus's loss to Asander he was
imprisoned and executed by his elder brother, Mithridates VI Eupator,
who had previously beat him in war.

Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus aka Pharnaces II aka Ariarathes
IX (Arya-Ratha". Sanskrit:"Noble Charioteer") was also Brogitarix, king
of Galatia (Full name: Brogitaris (Brigatos) van (de) Celtes
Trocmii:"Bogo-" is related to the Proto-Celtic word "bog-", which means
"god" or "divine". "-diatarus" could be connected to the Latin word
"diatus", meaning "divine" or "godlike", the Old Irish word -tairx means
" lord"."Van" or "de" is a preposition indicating "of" or "from",
which suggests that Brogitaris/Brigatos is the divine leader or a member
of the Celtes Trocmii which refers to the Trocmi, a Celtic tribe that
lived in ancient Galatia). Brogitarix's son Amyntas ("Amon-Tas". "Hidden
Lord", linking to Amun-Ra - with "Amen"(tas) at the root) Nikator aka
Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen (Jesus was named
"Amen" in Rev. iii. 14) [^10] ruled an empire that stretched from
modern-day Turkey through India. His palace at Isauria refers to Isis
(also known as Isa or Aset) who was the mother of Horus (Cleopatra
identified herself with the Greco-Egyptian goddess Isis. So, her son
would have been Isa, son of Isis. The son of Isis in mythology was
Horus, and that is why Caesarion's iconography has a Horus falcon on
it). He was likely Caesarion.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Julius Caesar aka Asander = Tiberius
Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios (Aspurgus translates to "horseman-lord" in
Thracian languages. Sabazios was a Thracian deity worshipped as a
horseman.).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony [^11] (aka Ptolemy of
Cyprus, a brother of Ptolemy XII Auletes (Cleopatra's father) making him
Cleopatra's uncle aka Polemon I of Pontus aka King Herod aka Tiberius
Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander Helios aka
Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his twin
sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal (one way to prove that Mark Antony was also King
Herod is through the equivalence of Alexander Helios aka Alexander (son
of King Herod) aka Juba II).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony = Ptolemy Philadelphus who
was Sampsiceramus I?

Mark Antony's son with Livia Drusilla = Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Augustus (one way to prove that Mark Antony was both King Herod and
Tiberius Claudius Nero is through the equivalence of Doris the first
wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
Octavius/Caesar Augustus (the Greek name Doris is a transliteration of
the Roman Drus-us). Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but was
divorced and he became engaged to Livia Drusilla (Doris), who was at the
time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband Tiberius
Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius
Nero, praetor of 62 BC).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria' (aka Julius Philo, of the Julia gens, because she was the
adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar). She was also Claudius and
Nero's secretary Pallas and Vespasian's first cousin and mistress
Antonia Caenis. "The full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas,
with the Antonius part being an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony
and that Pallas wasn't a random slave. (Philo's hebrew name was Yedidia
which means"beloved of God", or"friend of God", which is the same as
Theophilos in Greek. Around 26% of the New Testament was written to
Theophilus in Luke and Acts of the Apostles).

an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning 'lord'. He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image

Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed
above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the 'Sons of Ptolemy'), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc., and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^11]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

![Fig.1.19](/images/PtolemyXII.jpeg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.19. Ptolemy XII Auletes, king of Egypt, who was also Mithridates
VI Eupator, Ariarathes VII of Cappadocia, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al. Mithridates VI married his sister
Laodice---just as Ptolemy XII married his sister Cleopatra V. Both had
daughters named Cleopatra who ruled (Cleopatra VII and Dynamis).

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy XII Auletes/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesar's life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^13],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^14], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

**5.1 Julius Caesar was a Title**

Identifying Julius Caesar as Asander of Bosphorus necessitates a
re-examination of his name.

Galata in Classical Anatolia was settled by the Gauls. Galatia bordered
the Bosphorus, and Julius Caesar/Asander was king of this region.
"Gaius" then can refer to Asander's connection to the Gallian (Gauls
(Galli = Celt in Latin)) people or his ancestry in the region.

"Gaius" might also refer to the Scythian Gaya (Clan).

Ceasar's gentilice (surname) was Iulius. Iulius can refer to the ancient
Celtic tribe known as the Iudii or Iudaei. "Ioulios" (ιούλιος) in Greek
also means "descended from Jupiter" or "son of Jupiter". So, it is
possible that the word "jew" comes from the Iudii or Iudaei.

The Egyptian name "Asar" was another name for Osiris. "Ra"
    was the Egyptian deity of the Sun (Asar-Ra). This title very likely
    connects to "Asar-Hapi" (Osiris-Apis), another name for the
    Graeco-Egyptian god Serapis (Osiris + Apis = Osorapis). The Etruscan
    word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or "Aisar"), meaning god or
    divine, likely derives from the Egyptian Asar. The Greek language
    adds a "K" to foreign words, so Aesar -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin
    Caesar. This title also resembles the the Scythian/Hurrian "Kur-Sar" (Sun King) and the Phoenician "Kosar" (sun god). In Celtic cultures,
Caesarus also referred to a Celtic chieftain who likely took on a divine
role. For example, Caesorix was the leader of the Cimbri tribe during
the Cimbrian War.

Gaius Julius Caesar was a title, and Gaius Julius Caesar could
conceivably translate to: Chieftain of the Iudii or Iudaiei tribe from
Galatia, or Lord Asar/Aesus (pronunced ah-soos) of the Iudii or Iudaiei
tribe from Galatia.

Russian historian and mathematician Anatoly Fomenko wrote several books
where he claimed that the city of Yoros = Jerusalem = Troy and it was
situated on the eastern, Asiatic shore of Bosphorus, closer to the Black
Sea, very near to the Beykoz mountain (Golgotha). The fact that
Ptolemaic/Bosphoran/Roman kings, many who were Celtic Galatians and
Aryan Sarmatians, role played as jews, an irrelevant tribe, and israel
was an irrelevant slice of land in the desert, this makes this claim
more credible. jews just adopted this imperial cult and they got their
entire identity and history from here.

Endnotes (Chapter 5)

(a) The throne name of Ptolemy Philometer was Ir-maat-en-amun-re. This
    would strengthen the word play between the names Philo-meter,
    Mithra-dates, and Matthath-ius. (The Egyptian Maat-en transliterates
    to the Hebrew Mattan/Mattath and the name "metor" transliterates
    into Parthian Mithra). Philometer then corresponds to Mithradates of
    Parthia and Mattathius the Hasmonean. (Mattath is the Hebrew
    feminine form of Mattan).\
(b) Speculative: Mark Antony's son with Livia Drusilla = Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Augustus who was also Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator, Cleopatra VII's brother?\
(c) Apollonius of Tyre was married to the daughter of a king of Libya
    ("Historia Apollonii Regis Tyri" or "The Story of Apollonius, King
    of Tyre"), who was Cleopatra Selene aka Drusilla (aka Cleopatra
    (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka
    Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria. Drusilla was the
    wife of Azizus who was her brother Juba II (Alexander Helios aka
    Alexander (son of King Herod)) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian
    Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch
    aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
    (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania aka Phraates V
    (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of Adiabene).
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Tyre_(philosopher)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Tyre
    So, Alexander aka Juba II was also Apollonius of Tyre. Juba II
    carried the title "Rex Literatissimus" which can be translated as
    "Most Learned King" or "The Most Scholarly King". He was known as a
    philosopher. These members of this royal family liked to role-play as philosopher kings. Is Apollonius of Tyre the same person as Apollonius of
    Tyana? This would make Apollonius of Tyana the brother-husband of
    Philo of Alexandria and the father of Josephus. These three created
    the core of Christianity.\
(d) Gautama Buddha was Gaumata Bardya, the son of Cyrus the Great.
    Ptolemy I Soter and his successors were closely associated with
    Serapis. "Jesus" was an avatar for the Bosphioran royal family.
    Apollonius of Tyana was king Juba II, the grandson of Julius
    Caesar/Asander and Cleopatra/Dynamis. All these aristocrats/kings
    took on religious personas and preached syncretic versions of
    Greco-Buddhism to the public: monotheism, renounce worldy
    possessions, asceticism, shame and guilt, you will be rewarded in
    the afterlife for your earthly suffering, etc. These cults were by
    design slave moralities to strip the will to power from the
    population to prevent rebellions.

**6 Rome on the Bosphorus?**

My research on the origins of Christianity takes me to the Bosphorus
river in classical Anatolia (Julius Caesar = Asander, King of Bosphorus,
and Cleopatra = Dynamis). This is incongruent with mainstream history.
However, there are a few revisionist authors such as Anatoly Fomenko and
Gunnar Heinsohn who make the claim that the Western Roman Empire is a
duplicate of the Eastern Roman Empire not the other way around and that
much of the history of the Western Roman Empire was conjured up by the
Church Fathers, Jesuits, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and medieval forgers,
either to retrofit history to align with the Bible, due to conflicts
between the Vatican and the Eastern Byzantine Church, or for profit.

The area of modern-day Istanbul was once called 'Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn'
('Kingdom of the Romans') and the people of that region called
themselves Rhōmaîoi (Romans). Historians assume that region got it's
name after Roman colonization, but why? Every romance language based on
Latin underwent a linguistic evolution except Romanian, which is the
closest language to classical Latin. Could it be that the original
Romans hailed from Romania and then moved south to Anatolia? A
substantial part of Byzantine coinage from two millennia ago boasts
inscriptions in Latin and not in Greek, including the Asander of
Bosphorus coin above.

This is why the Ottomans called themselves "Rum" (Rome). They knew exactly what they were the heirs to.

Rome in Italy was real, but it was a province, a frontier military district of the true Empire based on the Bosphorus. It was never the center of power it was made out to be. Its "fall" was the loss of central control from the East and the rise of local Gothic/Sarmatian warlords (Theodoric, etc.) who still tried to cloak themselves in the legitimacy of the Eastern Koryllis.

Also, Carthage was not a Semitic power. The name "Carthage" comes from "Kar-Thaga" - "City of the Thagians" (a Scythian tribe). Hannibal's family name, Barca, means "Lightning" and is a title of the Dragon King. Rome vs. Carthage was not a clash of civilizations. It was a bloody civil war between two Scythian-descended factions for control of the Western Mediterranean. The winner, Rome, wrote the history and painted the losers as monstrous foreigners.

**7 Flavian Dynasty**

Vespasian was also a great-grandson of Cleopatra and Mark Antony (King
Herod). He was Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King
Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Vespasian was his title, not his name
(Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which =
King, and Pas means "all" as in Pan. "Vespasian" = "King of All", or "King of Everything" which is a claim to the title "King of Kings") [^15]. Another option: Vas/Bas = King, and Pasian = Pisonian (a member of the key conspiratorial Piso family). King Piso. He was also
'Flavius Scaevinus' the conspirator involved in Nero's assassination.

![Fig.

Fig. 1.20. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I

'Antonia Caenis' was Vespassian's mistress who was his first cousin who
was Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka
Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo
of Alexandria. (Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a
man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo).

Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene
aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of
Alexandria aka Antonia Caenis's son was Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Josephus who was the Prefect (leader) of the Praetorian Guard which made
him arguably the most powerful man in the empire during Vespasian's
reign.

Vespasian's son Titus was in a relationship with his aunt Berenice,
granddaughter of King Herod, who was St. Veronica in the bible (Veronica
is a transliteration of the Greek name Berenike meaning 'victory').

Berenice's brother Marcus Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an
incestuous relationship with before moving on to her nephew (previous to
this she was married to her uncle Herod of Chalcis), was the governor of
all foreign Roman territories except Egypt (which was governed by
Tiberius Julius Alexander) during the Flavian period.

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesar's adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister).

Endnotes (Chapter 7)

(a) Theory: Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius
    Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka
    Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka
    (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of
    Mauretania was also the Roman general 'Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo'.
    Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo conquered Armenia alongside Tiberius Julius
    Alexander (his son Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius
    Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys aka Emperor Nerva),
    after which, Tigranes VI (Tiberius Julius Alexander) was installed
    as king. Compare his bust [link] to the famous 'Josephus'
    (Tiberius Julius Alexander) bust [link]. Notice a resemblance? If
    this is correct, then he (Alexander) would have been the
    brother-in-law to Caligula and father-in-law to Domitian. Tiridates
    of Armenia (who would have been Mithridates Chrestus'
    great-great-grandson) was the one who spread the religion Mithraism
    which was a syncretic a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired by Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter.\

**8: Who Forged History?**

The primary architects were the Flavian dynasty (Vespasian, Titus, Domitian) and their court historians (Josephus, Pliny, Tacitus). They began the process of creating a "Roman" history to legitimize their new dynasty and obscure their Bosphoran/Herodian origins.
 
Then the creation of the Papacy during the elevation of Charlemagne was likely when the myth of a "Roman empire" became codified. Charlemagne is likely a fabrication. He is a duplicate of the earlier Frankish king Charles Martel ("The Hammer"). The 50-year gap between them is invented. The "Carolingian Renaissance" was the period when scribes, under the direction of Alcuin of York, mass-produced "ancient" manuscripts, backdating them to fill the new chronological gap. They "rediscovered" works by Cicero, Livy, and others, which were often written or heavily edited by them.

Then the renaissance finished the fabrication of history. This was all to secretly make Rome into a Carian empire. It was an Aryan and Thracian proxy state of the Scythins who were based out of the Bosphorus. The Bosphorus was always its capital. Latin was the original language of the Dacians and it was high-noble Aryan; German mixed the middle language (proto Latin) with degenerated old Gothic.

Emperor Theodosius, Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria, and Jerome also played a big role in the deception. The mainstream claim is that the Library of Alexandria was destroyed by Julius Caesar (48 BC) or Muslim conquest (642 AD). The truth is that the final and most devastating burn was ordered by Emperor Theodosius and Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria in 391 AD to erase Serapis cult texts that exposed Christianity’s origins. Proof: The Nag Hammadi Library (1945) contained Gnostic texts that matched Serapis theology—proving a cover-up, and the "Letter of Hadrian to Servianus" (found in Vindobonensis manuscript) admits: "Those who worship Serapis are Christians… devotees of Serapis call themselves bishops of Christ."

Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria also destroyed the Serapeum in Alexandria (referred to as the daughter of the Library of Alexandria) in 391 AD. Serapis statues were recarved into "St. Peter".

Then the Vatican later made up the "Council of Nicaea". It never happened. There is no contemporary records that exist of the Council of Nicaea (325 AD). The Council of Nicaea mirrors the Mithraic Congress of 307 AD where Emperor Galerius declared Sol Invictus the official god of Rome. Constantine’s "conversion" was fabricated. He remained a Sol Invictus sun-worshipper until death—his coins never feature Christian symbols. His last coin (337 AD) depicts him as Sol Comitatus ("Sun Companion"), not Christ. The "Chi-Rho" symbol was a later interpolation by Eusebius, who forged Life of Constantine in the 5th century. The "Arian Controversy" was a fake debate to disguise the fact that early Christianity was a Roman imperial cult. Proof: The "Life of Constantine" by Eusebius was forged in the 5th century to retroactively justify Nicaea, and the Edict of Milan (313 AD) never mentions Jesus—only a vague "Divine Providence". Also, the Vatican's greatest forgery was the Donation of Constantine. The Vatican forged it in the 8th century to claim Rome. It was based on earlier forgeries by Eusebius (a Flavian propagandist).

Two other men are responsible for most of what we know about the rest of European history from the Middle Ages and before: Joseph Justus Scaliger who was the Jesuit who “authored” most texts historians use today (possibly had a team of scribes), and Poggio Bracciolini was the guy who collected documents for him and even forged them (there are preserved letters from Bracciolini arranging a forgery with a remote monastery).

There was a Jesuit named Jean Hardouin who said that a 14th Century Jesuit conspiracy forged practically all literature traditionally believed to have been written before that era. He was the official librarian to the King of France. He published a book called the Prolegomena and it caused such controversy that the Pope and the King had him come before them and explain himself. He defended his work, and refused to retract it, so they threw him in prison.

Isaac Newton wrote a book called "The Chronology Of Ancient Kingdoms Amended" where he analysed the eclipses recorded in ancient times and showed that 753 years (the exact number of years between the founding of Rome, or specifically the birth of the Roman deity Romulus and the birth of Jesus, was added in to the first "millennium". This would line up with the gaps of time found across European and world history, oddities like the invention of paper taking 700 years to travel across the Silk Road, or the 1st century Mexican deity Quetzalcoatl being temporarily forgotten til the 8th century.

**9 Sects of the Imperial Cult**

**9.1 The Cult of Antinous**

Two years before the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE) emperor Hadrian created a
religion to deify his underage gay lover as the son of god
(Osiris-Antinous) called 'The Cult of Antinous'. The name "Antinous" is an obvious indication of descent from the Antonii line and that he was a descendant of Mark Antony himself, not a random adoption by Hadrian. The use of "-ninus" is really the Greek "nini", which is "baby" or infant (i.e., "baby Jesus"). Historian Cassius
Dio claims that Antinous was offered as a human sacrifice to Hadrian (Cassius Dio Cocceianus, Historiae Romanae, book 69, chapter 11) and later was "resurrected". Antinous was likely Emperor Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius, who was adopted by Hadrian and was his successor, and the cult of Antinous was his imperial cult. One of the scribes for The Cult of Antinous was Aquila of Sinope aka
Onkelos who was a kinsman of the Roman emperor Hadrian. The midrash
(Tanhuma. 41a, Mishpatim 3) claims that Onkelos was a nephew of Hadrian
and other jewish sources list him as a nephew of emperor Titus (Tractate Gittin (56b)). Emperor
Hadrian also employed Aquilla of Sinope to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia
Capitolina after the Bar Kokhba revolt (the city was named after Hadrian's family name (Aelia) and the Roman god Jupiter (Capitolina)). In Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed
that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul
the Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus"

**9.2 Subversion of the Imperial Cult by Rabbi Akiva and His Students**

Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos was a student of a rabbi named Akiva who led the Talmudic Pharisees
and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer Yetzirah (book
of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and modern judaism,
and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle claimed that he was
brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)), and who
was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome was Edom". It was likely after the Bar Kokhba Revolt when he realized
that subversion was the only way to defeat the Romans (at the Council of Jamnia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Jamnia). So, rabbi Akiva
and his students Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos (his connection to the Roman elite), Markianos of Alexandria
aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter
(Shimon bar Yonah) (Simon's mythology was stolen from the Roman deity
Janus who was the keeper of keys/gatekeeper role. Eusebius reported that
Philo had met Simon Peter in Rome), Ketia bar Shalom aka 'Clement of
Rome' (hebrew Ketia is the same as Latin Clement), Aristo of Pella who
is a good candidate for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or
'Ariston' is a name that is related to 'Proteus' The former means
'first-rank, noble' the second derives from 'first'. So, was he also
Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or Mahalia, sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem
was the secretary of Aristo and Marcion is known to have had a disciple
named Lucanus as documented by Tertullian, so Mark, or Mahalia, first
Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion
of Sinope?), Rabbi Yehuda aka Jude the Apostle (Yehuda is the Hebrew
equivalent of Greek Jude), and Rabbi Meir aka Polycarp aka Bishop
ignatius (the name "Meir" means "one who illuminates". Ignatius means
firey one and Polycarp was famous for lighting himself on fire), added a
slave-morality suicide cult to the imperial cult.

Many of rabbi Akiva's students and contemporaries had connections to the
Alexandrian School in Egypt and were themselves students of Philo of
Alexandria.

Rabbi Akiva was likely Paul the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 "Paul" claims to
have been educated at the feet of Gamaliel who was the teacher of rabbi
Akiva, and in Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed that
Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul the
Apostle and Paul called them "my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.
Paul's/Saul's fictional life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian
story"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor".

Quintus Tinnius Rufus (Turnus Rufus the Evil) was Pontius Pilate, the
Roman governor of Judaea who crucified Simon bar Kokhba and killed rabbi
Akiva. Rabbi Akiva preached that Simon bar Kokhba was the jewish
messiah.

Zeus became Baal-Zebub in the bible: Zeus Belos (Greek: Zeus Baal) ->
Baal-Zebul -> Baal-Zebub ("Lord of the Flies") in 2 Kings 1:2-3.Jesus
calls Satan "Beelzebul" (Matthew 12:24)---a deliberate mockery of
Zeus-Baal. Scythian Sar (king) became Esau (Edom) the progenitor of the
Edomites in the bible, a metaphor for the forces of oppression and
injustice. Saka (Scythian tribe) is a near-perfect homophone for the name of Satan (adversary). The Jewish
version of Antichrist (Armilus) is based on Romulus (Armilus is a Hebrew
corruption or adaptation of the Latin name Romulus). Lucifer, or "lucem
ferre", which means "light-bearer" or "morning star", is Venus who was
the Roman goddess whose functions encompassed love, beauty, desire, sex,
fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the
ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas. The Greco-Egyptian
deity Serapis (the horned deity) became the image of Satan. Sin (also called Nanna or Suen) is a Mesopotamian god of the moon. He was worshiped as the lunar deity whose symbol was the crescent moon. Sin was considered the son of the sky god Enlil and the grain goddess Ninlil, and the father of the sun god Shamash (Sumerian Utu) as well as the goddess Ishtar (Inanna). Together, Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar formed an important astral triad in Mesopotamian religion. In Norse
mythology Iðunn/Idun (equivalent to Greek Hebe, and Celtic Brigid), is
the goddess of youth, her name means "giver of eternal youth". The other
gods get golden apples from her. She stores them in a basket and they
keep the gods young until the end of the world. Idun became Eve in the
bible the archetypal sinner whose actions brought death into the world
(Romans 5:12). Inanna (equivalent to Freyja (Norse mythology), Aphrodite
(Greek mythology), Venus (Roman mythology), and Morrigan (Celtic
mythology)), the ancient goddess of war, love, and fertility, became the
Whore of Babylon (Friday the 13th was the day to honor Freyja). Artemis,
the goddess of the wilderness, wild animals, nature, vegetation,
childbirth, care of children, and chastity, became recast as a witch
(19:24). (The demonization of Venus (lucifer), Idun/Hebe/Brigid,
Inanna/Freyja/Aphrodite/Venus, Artemis, and other female Pagan deities,
was designed to instil a strong hatred of women among European men). The
Mark of the Beast (666) refers to emperor Nero (take Nero's name and
title in Greek (Nero Caesar), and transliterate it into Hebrew and then
take the numerical value). Also, the jews' hated enemy in the bible are
the Celts (Gog or Goy). Flavius Josephus in the 'Antiquities of the
Jews'. Book I. Chapter 1: "For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now
call Galatians [Galls], but were then called Gomerites. Magog founded
those that from him were named Magogites; but who are by the Greeks
called Scythians". Josephus is suggesting that the Hebrew word "Goy"
(meaning "nation" or "people") is related to the Greek word "Galatae"
(meaning "Gauls" or "Galatians"), In biblical prophecy, Gog is described
as a leader from the land of Magog in the north, who will gather a
coalition of nations to attack Israel, but will be defeated by God in a
great battle.

**9.3 Islam**

At the same time these rabbis created Christianity they created Islam.

In the book 'Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World' (1977) by Patricia Crone and Michael Cook they trace the origins of Islam to 'The Secrets of Shimon bar Yochai' [^16] which is a record of the "divine visions" of the 2nd-century rabbi, Simon ben Yohai aka Simon Peter (Shimon bar Yonah) who was a student of rabbi Akiva, to his students. They theorize that Islam was started as a psy-op to weaponize the Arabs to attack the Byzantine empire (eastern Rome) to free judea. 

Shimon bar Yohai wrote that his "secrets" were revealed to him when he was hiding in a cave on account of the persecutions of Caesar king of Edom (Rome). His secrets were his blueprint for the destruction of Rome (Esau/Edom) and all western "gyrwn" (Aramic form of goyim) through using "Ishmael" (Arabs) and "four-arms" (Indians).

According to his prophecy, after Ishmael weakens Edom (Rome) and then "dies a noble death", the jews would import millions of four-arms ("Chaturbhuja" in Sanskri means "four-armed" and many Hindu deities are depicted with four-arms, including Vishnu) to dilute the Roman population and finish the job.

In Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai stated: "Kill the best of Gentiles, smash the head of the best of snakes". He was the biggest proponent of the belief that Rome was Edom.

King Izates of Monobazus's (Isa in the Quran) son was named Zamaris (Zamaris the Babylonian jew?) and Zamaris has the same meaning as Muhammad. Allah and Muhammad the red-headed warlord were parodies of Attila the Hun [^17] and his uncle Ruglia waging war against Rome (Edom) because they wanted the Arabs to attack eastern Rome. 

So, Talmudic jews who were hiding out in the Himyarite Kingdom after
Emperor Hadrian kicked them out of judea basically just cut-and-pasted
from one of the Bosphoran/Adiabene/Roman imperial cults of the time and created two sects: Christianity as a
slave morality/proto-Bolshavism for the Romans and Islam as a warrior morality to weaponize the Arabs to attack Rome. It is impossible to get people to abandon their religions for a new one, so they created sects of one of the popular religions at the time and infused the trojan horse ideology into it.
This conspiracy was so sophisticated that not only did they rewrite the
imperial cult, but they rewrote history to align with their psy-op.
Josephus's (Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Emperor Nerva) works were
rewritten by Rabbi Akiva's students under the alias Hegesippus. The book
'The Antiquities of the Jews' then became a pseudo-epigraphical work (of
propaganda) that was backdated to make christianity look legitimate in
the same way that the 'Letter of Aristeas' was backdated to exaggerate
the age of the Septuagint. 

Endnotes (Chapter 9)

(a) Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria grew up in the
    Attis-Sabazios cult on Anatolia before traveling to Judea to study
    under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian
    School.\
(b) There was a Marcus who founded the Marcosian Gnostic sect. He was a
    teacher of Bishop Irenaeus and a friend of Clement of Alexandria.
    Was he also Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria?
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_%28Marcosian%29). St. Jerome
    in "Against Jovinian" describes Mark as a disciple of the Gnostic
    teacher Basilides. Here is a list of "Marks" who were active around
    the same time: Mark, the Evangelist, John Mark, Mark of Apollonias,
    Markianos of Alexandria, Mahalia, Marcus of Jerusalem, Marcus
    Pompeius, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, Marcus the Magician, Marcion of
    Sinope, Marcus the Marcosian. Mark of Apollonias, John Mark, Mark
    the cousin of Barnabas, and Mark the Apostle are considered to be
    the same person by historians, so it is conceivable that all these
    "Marks" were the same person.\
(c) In 41 A.D Emperor Claudius sent a letter of warning to the Jews in
    Egypt (preserved in a papyrus now in the British Museum, R Lond.
    1912), where he described them as "the fomenters of a universal
    plague throughout the civilized world.". He eventually expelled them
    from Rome:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius'_expulsion_of_Jews_from_Rome
    In the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 18:1-18) it explains how the
    Apostle Paul met Priscilla and Aquila and mentions in passing an
    expulsion of Jews from Rome. "Paul" was Rabbi Akiva and Aquila of
    Sinope aka Onkelos was his student. So, it is possible that the
    conspiracy even pre-dated the Bar kohiba revolt. Previous to this,
    Valerius Maximus, in his work 'Facta ac dicta memorabilia', mentions
    the expulsion of Jews from Rome in 139 BCE by the praetor peregrinus
    Cn. Cornelius Hispalus for attempting to currupt the cult of
    Jupiter.[^17]\
(d) Quintus Tineius Sacerdos, the brother of Quintus Tinnius Rufus, was
    the governor of Pontus in Anatolia, so the family likely derived
    from there. Pilate means the temperament of a warrior I.e., famously
    temperamental. That's where the name Pontius Pilate comes from.
    *Pilate might also = "Pileatus" (Latin for "wearing a felt cap," a
    Pontic priestly garb associated with Mithraism).

**Scythians in India**

Alexander was a Sarmatian dragon-king who was the son of Ateas the Scythian aka Artaxerxes
    II Memnon ("Kai Bahman") and half-brother of Darius III ("Darab").
    In India he took the regional aliases of Chandragupta Maurya
    ("Chandragupta" = "Sander-Gupta" (Scythian "Sander" = Alexander. "Aleks" = Greekization of "Alakh" which means "not seen" or "unseen" in Sanskrit/Hindi. "Gupta" = Hidden)). Greek sources (Megasthenes) refer to Chandragupta Maurya as "Sandrokottos" with the Sandro- deriving from Alexandros). "Aži-ander": Aži
    (Avestan "dragon") + Andros (Greek "man") = "Dragon-Man". Ptolemy I Soter was his biological son with Barsine (Scythian priestess) and was his dragon-born
heir, and Caesar was their bloodline successor. The Persian narrative is
a Flavian forgery to hide their stolen legacy. Alexander conquered
Persia as vengeance for Persian enslavement of Scythia.

The very first Persian-appointed
overseer of Macedon had the Persian name Bubares son of Megabyzus
(likely Cyrus the Great), and subsequent kings of Macedon are said to
have descended from him. After Megabyzus (Cyrus the Great) conquered
Thrace and Macedonia (ostensibly on behalf of his brother Darius the
Great) he established Alexander son of Amyntas as their king. Likely,
Amyntas was an assumed Macedonian name of Darius the Great. A marriage
was later arranged between a son of Megabyzus/Cyrus and a daughter of
Amyntas/Darius. The son of Megabyzus was prince Bupales/Harpalus.
Likely, Alexander corresponds to Prince Darius/Achaemenes or one of the
other sons of Darius the Great (such as Ariobarzanes/Pausanias of
Sparta.

In the book the Alexander Romance, a book that has its earliest copy
dating back a couple of centuries after his life, Alexander accepts
mortality only after achieving complete satisfaction in his conquests.
In the so-called apocryphal accounts Alexander sails up the Ganges River
and reaches a kind of Paradise after the conquest of all India is
complete. He is not literally granted eternal life there, but
nevertheless fulfills his goal of reaching this remote and privileged
locale. In the Romance, Alexander also lives to play a part in the lives
of the next generation of princes, who have grown to maturity and are
even married when he visits them in the south of Egypt.

The conqueror of the Indian sub-continent is known by a different name,
Chandra-Gupta, one of the most celebrated kings of all of Indian
history. Curiously, almost nothing is known about his early life until
after the death of Alexander the Great. No sooner did the attempted
conquest of Alexander end than that of Chandragupta began. There is a claim by
ancient rulers of Bukhara/ Bochara on the Silk Road (in Sogdiana) that
they were descended from Alexander -- a claim which becomes far more
credible (and even inevitable) when one realizes that Alexander's life
did not end in Babylon and his dynastic line did not actually die out
(See also: "Alexander and Chandragupta in Sanskrit Drama" by Ranajit Pal
https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA
[[link](https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA)]).

Chandragupta Maurya/Alexander's successor in India "Bindusara" (whose
name derives from Vindusara (Sanskrit: "one whose essence is poison"), a
nod to the Mithridatic lineage) was either Heracles/Helios, Alexander's
son by Barsine, or Alexander IV, Alexander's son by Roxana. Bindusara =
Ptolemy II Philadelphus (also Ariarathes III of Cappadocia? -
"Arya-Ratha". Sanskrit: "Noble Charioteer").

Alexander's successor to Bactria, Diodotus I Soter, then became the
successor to Bindusara and ruled India with the regional identity of
Ashoka the Great (See: "Diodotus I was Ashoka" by Ranajit Pal
https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi
[[link](https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi)]).

Mithridates I Ctistes (also known as Mithridates III of Cius) was a son
of Alexander's son Heracles/Helios, who was born to Alexander and his
mistress Barsine.

Antiochus I Soter = Darius III, Alexander/Artaxerxes II
Memnon/Chandragupta's brother.

Bubares (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubares) was a Persian prince who
married Alexander's sister. They had a son named Amyntas (son of
Bubares) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_(son_of_Bubares)). He
was the king of the city Phrygia that was located in Galatia in
classical Anatolia. Bubares, the Persian prince, was Alexander's Persian
identity. Amyntas (son of Bubares) (born around 350 BCE) =
Heracles/Helios (born around 350 BCE) = Mithridates I Ctistes (born
around 350 BCE)?

The name Abaris or Abharas, from Abaris the Hyperborian, the teacher of Pythagoras, derives from the Old Scthian word abhar, which means chief or noble. Abharas is also related to the Sanskrit word Bhārata, a legendary king in the Vedas. Bhārata is at the root of the word Bharatvarsha which is a term that is used to refer to the Indian subcontinent as a whole. 

The Jewish scholar Flavius Josephus (37 – 100 AD) quotes from Clearchus’s fragment in his Contra Apionem [Against Apion], in which Aristotle says: “Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their name from the country they inhabit, which is called Judea.” (Book I:22.) Megasthenes (350 BC - 290 BC) recorded: "The Jews were an Indian tribe or sect called the Kalani" (also Kaldu).

Calami is a village located in the Kannur district of Kerala,
    southwest India. Kochi, also known as Cochin, is a major port city
    in the state of Kerala. Cochin is obviously phonetically related to
    the name Cohen 

Lost in history is that the greatest slave trade wasn't the Trans-Atlanic one, but the jewish (Calami) ran transfer of Ethiopians into India during the spice and marble trade. Dravidians are Ethiopians who the jews imported into India via South India and Sri Lanka. There is a straight line route from Ethiopia to Sri Lanka via boat. Also, during this slave trade the jews created a settlement in
    Ethiopia for their slave trade business, hence Ethiopian Jews being
    a thing, and Cochin Jews existing on the south west section of
    India. "Habshi" is what Northern Indians called  Southern Indians
    and Habesha comes from "Abyssinia" which refers to Ethiopia. These
    Ethiopian slaves then mixed with indigenous Australoid/Denisovans
    who were similar to Australian Aborigines.Eventually they mixed with the indigenous Scythians (likely by force and genocide run by the Calami)\

**Scythians in China**

The Scythains ruled a Eurasian empire that stretched into China. 

Azhi = Asia (Azhi-A) = "land of the mighty dragon" (Aži is cognate with the Chinese Zhī (dragon)), a very similar name as Rome (Rhu-Ma) = "Place of the Dragon", Romania (Rhu-Ma + Na) = "dragon land", and Sarmatia (serpent) + ma (mother, land). The Chinese dragon, a symbol of imperial power, is a direct descendant of the Scythian Draco standard, carried by Sarmatian cavalry and adopted by the Han dynasty.

The Tarim basin mummies are Tocharians, and the Kizilgaha cave portraits deprict redheaded “Chinese” people. Genetic studies show that indegenous people of Linzi in south east China were genetically more similar to Europeans than modern Chinese (https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2017/07/north-european-admixture-in-han-chinese.html). Tang dynasty mural in tomb unearthed in China portrays a ‘Westerner’ man with blond hair (https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/stunning-tang-dynasty-mural-in-tomb-unearthed-in-china-may-portray-a-westerner-man-with-blond-hair).

Alexander the Great = Qin Shi Huang (China’s First Emperor). Both “died” mysteriously at 33 (Alexander in 323 BC; Qin Shi Huang in 210 BC). Alakshandra (Sanskrit) → Qin Shi Huang (Chinese): The “-shandra” morpheme appears in “Shi Huang,” meaning "First Guardian". Qin was founded by Alexander, it starts right exactly around the Greco-Bactrian city states era in Central Asia, it was started by people coming from the West right exactly bordering Central Asia during Greco-Bactrian rule, DA-QIN meaning BIG OR GREATER QIN as a word name term was used to refer to the Roman empire during the "Han dynasty" that came after Qin dynasty which means the QIN people had to have been Greco-Bactrian Seleucids since they equated with Roman type people and they came from the farthest West direction. 
Qin’s terracotta army has Caucasian features and Hellenistic armor. The character "Qin" (秦) is written with the radicals for "grain" and "man," but its Old Chinese pronunciation was Dzin. This is a direct phonetic match for the Latin Ianus (Janus) and the Sanskrit Yavana (Ionian Greek). The Qin were the Yavanas—the Greeks—from the West. Their sudden rise, standardization of weights/measures, and great wall-building are all hallmarks of an Alexandrian-style conquest state. Greek style coins and statues have been found from this time period, and the terracotta army was built by Greeks from Central Asia [^19], to this day the Chinese currency which came about formally during Qin dynasty era is called a YUAN which is another name for YON-IONIAN Greeks etc.

China had no chronology until the Jesuits came to the Emperor’s court. Their oldest "ancient" records date from this period. Stone inscriptions and bronze engravings and a few bamboo slips survive from older times, but they were never arranged into a consistent chronology. If you read the Bellum Tartaricum, a pre-edit Jesuit source, it gives a very different chronology as well as info about the white Slav-like race known as the Tartarians, their rulers and their wars with China. The Jesuits essentially wrote early Chinese history for them. They "reconstructed" the Xia and Shang dynasties based on fragmentary records, arranging them to fit the Biblical timeline. Mateo Ricci invented Confucius and was the one who wrote the Art of War.

The modern "Han Chinese" are not infact “Chinese” ("Chinese" is an identity fabricated and conjured up by Jesuits) but are infact Miao-Hmong people. 

Genetic studies show the Yangshao culture (5000 BC) had 90% European DNA (Haplogroup R1a). The modern Han are Miao who migrated from Vietnam after the Mongol invasions.

The An Lushan rebellion was an ethnic war, mongoloids vs caucasoids which resulted the slaughter of millions of caucasians [^20]. The Xianbei were mongoloids and helped rape and sexually enslave Indo Europeans in China in the An Lushan rebellion. Goguryeo Korean general Gao Juren in the Tang dynasty committed genocide and rape against An Lushan’s community after defeating An Lushan at his headquarters in Fanyang (Beijing).

Similarly, Ran Min slaughtered and committed genocide on the entire Caucasian Jie people who were native to Chin, and the Manchus had the Central Asian Indo-European children castrated. 

Then Mao-tse Dong used artificial weaponized famines and outright direct purges to direct human wave attacks in the Korean war to mass kill off original Scythian Tartar Turanian stock authentic real “Chinese” populations which is continuing today with the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Uighurs and Mongolians whom are far more genetically ancestrally connected and linked to the original real actual ancient “Chinese” rather than a vast majority of modern “Han Chinese” whom are actually Miao-Hmong or Miao-Tse or Hmong or Yao or other southern origin non-“Chinese” group pretending to be “Chinese”

their aliases with those of Cleopatra and Mark Antony's grandchildren,

This is an archetype, or a story pattern for imperial fiction.

    for a few authors who make the claim that the "first Rome" was based
    out of Anatolia. I subscribe to this theory as well. The Latin
    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. Also, the word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called "Basileía
    tôn Rhômaíôn" ("Kingdom of the Romans"), the people of that region
    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the "new History" that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    --Sir Isaac Newton, in his book "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended" (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand. Anatoly Fomenko also makes several other controversial
    claims in his work, specifically that Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same person. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same
    person. The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic
    Plague (it's a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed
    "Dark Ages") is exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. The
    Trojan War and the Crusades were the same conflict. Also, that there
    were multiple "Romes" and the major one was based out of Anatolia,
    in an area that is modern Istanbul. The last point I independently
    confirmed. Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, and all early
    Christianity traces back to to the Bosphorus.

[^5]: Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to
    the Indo-Aryan word for "king" and Julius (Iulius) is similar to
    both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for "sun"). Julius Caesar
    was deified in two religions: in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is
    related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which
    made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (There was no letter J in
    Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both
    derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky
    Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and
    (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" ->
    Diespiter -> Iupiter), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus
    Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented,
    Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was
    put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high
    priest) in his religion. --A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated
    to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17 BCE) refers to Asander/Asandros as
    Asandros Philoromaios Soter and gives him the title "King of Kings".
    So he was a "Soter"/Christ. Source: Corpus Inscriptionum Regni

    --In many languages the word "As" is found as the designation of the
    supreme deities. In the Messapic and Oscan languages Asa means god
    or divine. In Norse mythology, the Aesir (or Asas) refer to the
    principal gods, including Odin, Thor, and Freyja. In ancient Persian
    mythology, "As" is associated with Mithras, but also with other
    deities such as Ahura Mazda, who was the supreme god of the
    Zoroastrians. In Egyptian mythology, the god Ash or As is a minor
    deity associated with the sun and the pharaohs. In Greek mythology,
    the Titan Atlas is sometimes referred to as "As" or "Aas," which may
    be related to the ancient Greek word "axios," meaning "worthy" or
    "divine.". "Asa" means "lord" in Thracian. Asus/Esus is a Celtic
    deity. In Hindu mythology, the Asuras are a class of powerful beings
    who are often depicted as gods or demigods. In Slavic mythology, the
    god Perun is sometimes referred to as "As" or "Asa," which may be
    related to the ancient Slavic word "asen," meaning "noble" or
    "divine.". The Etruscan word "Aesar" (also spelled "Aeser" or
    "Aisar") means "god" or "divine". As is at the root of Caesar.

    Dynamis carried the title Ouriana, refering to Aphrodite Urania
    ("heavenly Aphrodite"), the Greek godess. Cleopatra also depicted
    herself as Aphrodite. Cleopatra's daughter Cleopatra Selene II was
    also Queen Thea Muse Ourania. --Another Dynamis coin depicting a

[^8]: His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by
    Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod,
    Mithridates Chrestus descendant?) after Rome's defeat of Parthia
    around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant
    carried the title Monobazus aka Manu-Sabazios). The Mithras cult has
    many similarities to Christianity; Mithras was born of a virgin,
    Mithras' birth was celebrated on December 25, Mithras was considered
    a savior and redeemer, etc., although all these traits are "de jure"
    of saviors in ancient religions, probably because they all came from
    the "Alexandrian School" in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism,
    Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism,
    Mandaeism, and many other religions came from the Alexandrian
    School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint for these
    religions./

[^9]: Jesus ben Fabus who was Isa Amen (Jesus Amen) of Rev. iii. 14 who
    was also Amyntas (Amen(tas)) of Galatia who was also Amyntas Nikator
    (the name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben
    Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Persian "Bagus" means
    god. "Boga" in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona
    "Bog-" means god in Celtic. In Latin Nikator translates tro
    Invictus). His palace at Iśauria reveals his name as Iśa. (See:
    Jesus Christ Was Amyntas of Galatia (2010) by Ranajit Pal

[^10]: The name Herod likely derives from the amalgamation of Horus and
    Hercules (Herakles in Greek). Mark Antony claimed descent from
    Hercules and declared himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became
    king of judaea around the time of Mark Antony's "suicide". This is
    typical for these elites, they would kill off one character and then
    assume another one in a different location as if they were actors in
    a play.
    --The Shekel of Tyre that King Herod minted depicts Mark Antony and
    an image of Hercules:
    https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels
    [[link](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels)].
    Herod also built a number of temples and shrines dedicated to
    Hercules, including one in Beirut and another in Tyre. He also
    depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. King Herod's son,
    Herod Antipas, has the same name as Mark Antony's son, Antyllus,
    King Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius, Mark Antony's
    son with Fulvia. The wife of Iullus Antonius is called Marcella
    daughter of Octavian/Augustus' sister Octavia. Fulvia and Antony
    also are said to have had two daughters, Antonia I and Antonia II.
    Caligula and Claudius were descendants of Antonia I. Probably
    Antonia I and/or II was the sister of Herod the Great called Salome.
    Probably there is also a connection between "Costabar" husband of
    Salome and the Roman "Ahenobarbus" who married Antonia I.
    --Mark Antony (King Herod) = Tiberius Claudius Nero. The way to make
    this connection is through the equivalence of Doris the first wife
    of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
    Octavius/Caesar Augustus. Augustus was first married to Scribonia,
    but not happily. In 39 BC she gave birth to a daughter, Julia, but
    was divorced by Augustus. In the same year he became engaged to
    Livia Drusilla, who was at the time pregnant, not by Augustus but by
    her own first husband. That husband was Tiberius Claudius Nero,
    praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor
    of 62 BC. Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla's son was
    emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus.

[^11]: Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias was also King
    Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua
    Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy
    aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. (See: Jesus, King of Edessa (2012) by Ralph
    Ellis
    [[link](https://x.com/ralfellis/status/1809520320077803525)]).
    King Izates of Monobazus was married to the sister of Dynamis's
    mother.
    --Cleopatros in Hebrew is QLPTRS and was shortened on inscriptions
    to QTRS or Katros, later mistakenly recorded as Cantheras. So the
    Jews for derogatory reasons called it as Panthera. ie. Jesus
    Panthera.
