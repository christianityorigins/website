#### Introduction

To maintain control over their subjects, imperial powers in antiquity employed a variety of strategies as part of their colonial program, including the creation of slave-morality cults, fictional stories, faked deaths and adoptions, and an endless series of regional aliases, to subjugate a population to their aristocratic rule and to prevent rebellions. In Sumer, the rulers were all priests, whereas in Egypt, the Pharaohs claimed to be sons of gods. It was in Egypt with Atenism, which was a religion to deify Pharaoh Akhenaten, where monotheism first emerged. The collectivization of divine authority with monotheism reinforces a universal morality and everything becomes collectivized with the centralization of power. This makes a group easier to control and is why monotheism mirrors autocratic governance. The Persians also deified their leaders, promoted monotheism (Zoroastrianism), and even took it a step further by incorporating a very powerful slave-morality religion into their imperial cult as part of their colonial program. They created Buddhism, with Gautama Buddha being Gaumata Bardya, also known as Smerdis, the son of Cyrus the Great, who governed the Persian province of Bactra. The Greeks followed this formula with the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander and the Serapis cult. Serapis was a universal composite deity created by blending the Egyptian gods Osiris and Apis with the Greek god Zeus (and others) to resonate with the multicultural society that Ptolemy I envisioned for Egypt. The Romans adopted this formula and established their own imperial cults. These imperial powers maintained their empires through religious syncretism and slave-morality religions, which stripped the population of their will to power. Christianity is a relic of one of these imperial slave moralities, which itself was subverted by a confederation of rabbis after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE).

Note on aliases: I believe that the royal elites in antiquity role-played as if they were characters in a play, and they used regional aliases and fictional deaths as story patterns or archetypes. They killed off one character and then assumed the role of another one in a different location. For example, the governor of Roman Egypt from 33 CE to 38, Aulus Avillius Flaccus, was also Polemon II of Pontus, who was the prince of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, which was the regional alias of Emperor Titus. The character of Aulus Avillius Flaccus dies at the same time Polemon II of Pontus takes power, and then Polemon II of Pontus dies around the same time Titus becomes emperor. The way of connecting them is through the fact that they were all married to the same woman, Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod.

Julius Caesar was Asander of Bosphorus. Cleopatra was Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus. Mark Antony was King Herod, the king of Judea; Tiberius Claudius Nero, and Phraates IV the 'King of Kings' of the Parthian Empire. Vespasian was Herod Pollio and Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV. All evidence to prove my claims will be found in the following chapters.

Note on locations: After a year of research, I believe that much of what we know about history from antiquity is fabricated. I believe that the Church Fathers and the Vatican transposed Rome from the Bosphorus in classical Anatolia to Italy and not the other way around as conventionally told. Later, the Jesuits and people like Joseph Justus Scaliger, who was the Jesuit priest who "discovered" the majority of texts from antiquity that we use today, usually on demand, and Poggio Bracciolini, who was the individual responsible for collecting documents for him, further added to the distortion of historical records. This manipulation of historical facts has led to a distorted understanding of the past, and it is likely that many events, dates, and figures have been altered or fabricated to serve the interests of the Church and other powerful institutions.

#### 1 Name and Title Meanings

-   Christ: In Greek "The Anointed One" is Chréstos/Christ. Christ is identical to the title Soter. Several historical figures were Christs/Soters. In Isaiah 45:1 the jews called Cyrus the Great "The Anointed One". Alexander the Great was also a Chréstos/Soter (Josephus. Antiquities, XI. 8. Talmud, Yoma 67b).
-   Cotys: In Thracian, "Cotys" is related to the word "kotys" which is a title that means "lord". In the Celtic languages the word "cottos" or "cottius" means "chieftain". 
-   Izates or Izas: An ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning "lord".
-   Monobazus: Sabazios is the Phrygian and Thracian version of Zeus. Ma'nu is likely a diminutive of Menneus ("son of man"), and then Manu-Sabazios becomes Monobazus. Monobazus also becomes "Bazus" or "Bar Izates" shortened to "baYZTus" (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which then becomes "bOETHus". The Boethusians were a jewish priestly sect.
-   Piso cognomen: "Appius" is a cognomen (personal name) of the Claudian family. Appius and Piso are synonymous (In Greek, Appius is rendered as Appios, from there Piso). The name Piso itself would be a form of Peisistratos/Pisistratos, the leading name of ancient Athens in Greece. (Pisistratos is a Latinized spelling of the Greek Peisistratos) It could be said that all the ruling elite of the Julio-Claudian dynasty were Pisos, including Nero who was nearly deposed by a Piso. Appius is also cognate with Arrius (through rhotacization in ancient Latin the /p/ and /r/ could be swapped).

#### 2 Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus \

There was a Byzantine [^1] imperial cult where Julius Caesar [^2] took on the role of Asander, King of Bosphorus [^3] ("Asa" means "lord" in Thracian, and "andros" means "man" or "son of man" in Greek. Jesus is refered to as "the son of man" 81 times in the four canonical gospels. Asandro can also be interpreted as "son of the lord" or "son of Asa, the lord". The Thracian version of Zeus was Asa/Asaeus and the Celtic version of Zeus was Esus), and his wife Cleopatra used the regional alias of Dynamis Ourania [^4] (translates to 'heavenly power'), queen of Bosporus. The city of Byzantium, later called Constantinople and now Istanbul was/is located in the area called Bosphorus.

Fig. 1.1. Julius Caesar. One side of the coin shows a crescent and the other side shows a Nike which was the Greek goddess of victory and a close companion to Zeus.

Fig. 1.2. Coin of Asander, King of Bosphorus depicting a Nike

![Fig.1.3](/images/asander.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.3. Another depiction of Asander which shows the star and cresent that is visible in the Julius Caesar coin above. The coin also shows a winged Pegasus all within a Dionysiac wreath of ivy and fruit. 

![Fig.1.4](/images/Cleopatra%20VIIDynamis.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.4. (L) Dynamis, Queen of Bosphorus, (R) Cleopatra VII. There were obviously many years between the ages that she was depicted, however, even in the elder Dynamis bust you can see her lazy eye and abnormally large eyes which she was reported to have had, possibly as a consequence of inbreeding. 

![Fig.1.5](/images/cleopatra.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.5. (L) Julia Mamaea, Queen of Pontus (wife of Polemon II), (R)
Cleopatra VII. Polemon Pythodoros, King of Pontus was Julius Caesar/Asander's
regional alias (Asander and Polemon were both married to Dynamis), and if he also played the religious role of Gaius Julius
Sohaemus of Emesa, Priest-King of Emesa, and Cleopatra played the
regional role of Pythodorida Philometor, then Julia Avita Mamaea of
Emessa would have been their daughter. Do you see a resemblance? She
would have been married to her half-brother (Cleopatra and Mark Antony's son) Polemon II, King of Pontus
aka Ptolemy Philadelphus aka Sampsiceramus I? The Bosphorus Kingdom,
also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, was located next
to the Pontus Kingdom

Asander was born in 110 BCE, the same year as Julius Caesar. Dynamis was
born in 70/69 BCE, the same year as Cleopatra VII. Julius Caesar was 30
years older than Cleopatra, and Asander was also 30 years older than
Dynamis.

A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca. 47--17
BCE), refers to Asander as the 'Great King of Kings Asandros
Philoromaios Soter' (Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani 30). So, he
was a 'King of Kings', Soter (savior), and 'The Great'. Individually,
each of those titles carries significance, but the 'Great King of Kings'
title in that inscription stands out because it is a rare title that was
used by Cyrus the Great and Alexander the Great, so this shows Asander's
level of prestige and power to be placed alongside those two. Julius
Caesar is the only historical figure who had a comparable level of
prestige as Cyrus and Alexander.

Dynamis's grandfather was Mithridates VI Eupator who also carried the
title "King of Kings". Her uncle was Mithridates 'Chrestus' [^5].
Mithridates translates to 'the gift of Mithra' in ancient Persian and is
an obvious reference to the Mithras cult. Asander beat Mithridates
Chrestus in battle to become King of Bosphorus. One source I read
claimed that this was a fratricidal war and that Asander and Mithridates
Chrestus were brothers. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the city is
founded as the result of a fratricide, with the twins Romulus and Remus
quarreling over who has the favor of the gods and over each other's
plans to build Rome, with Romulus becoming Rome's first king and
namesake after killing his brother (this also mirrors the biblical
account of Cain and Abel). This would make Asander Dynamis's uncle and
husband. Asander beating Mithridates Chrestus in battle to become ruler
of Bosphorus also parallels Julius Caesar beating Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus
(Pompey the Great) to become ruler of Rome. If they were in fact
brothers, then Mithridates VI Eupator's son Machares was born in 110 BCE,
the same year as Asander and Julius Caesar, so that would be his real
name.

Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen
(Jesus Amen of Rev. iii. 14) [^6] was married to Stratonice who was the
sister of Asander. He was also a cousin of Dynamis and Asander. Amyntas
Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia ruled an empire that stretched from
modern-day Turkey through India.

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Julius Caesar aka Asander = Tiberius
Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios, who was born about the same time as
Caesarion (Aspurgus translates to "horseman-lord" in Thracian languages.
Sabazios was a Thracian deity worshipped as a horseman).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony [^7](aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander Helios
aka Alexander (son of King Herod) aka Juba II who was married to his
twin sister Cleopatra Selene II aka Queen Thea Muse Ourania. Juba II of
Mauritania's full name was Gaius Iulius Iuba, prenomen and nomen after
his adopted father Gaius Iulius Caesar, and 'Iuba' is most likely a
diminutive of 'Iehuva'. He was the claimed royal heir of the Massylii
tribe, which is the 'Messiah' lineage from David's firstborn son with
Saul's daughter Michal (one way to prove that Mark Antony was also King
Herod is through the equivalence of Alexander Helios aka Alexander (son
of King Herod) aka Juba II).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's son with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Ptolemy
Philadelphus who was Sampsiceramus I?

Mark Antony's (aka King Herod aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV
of Parthia) son with Livia Drusilla = emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar
Augustus (one way to prove that Mark Antony was both King Herod and
Tiberius Claudius Nero is through the equivalence of Doris the first
wife of Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
Octavius/Caesar Augustus (the Greek name Doris is a transliteration of
the Roman Drus-us). Augustus was first married to Scribonia, but was
divorced and he became engaged to Livia Drusilla (Doris), who was at the
time pregnant, not by Augustus but by her own first husband Tiberius
Claudius Nero, praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius
Nero, praetor of 62 BC).

Cleopatra aka Dynamis's grandson with Mark Antony (aka King Herod aka
Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of Parthia) = Alexander (grandson
of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka
Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius
Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka
Ptolemy of Mauretania (aka 'Joseph Panthera', the name for jesus's
father in the Talmud; Panthera is a corruption of Cantheras, or
Cleopatros) aka Phraates V (the "King of Kings") aka Monobazus I King of
Adiabene, who was married to his sister Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka 'Philo of
Alexandria' (aka Julius Philo, of the Julia gens, because she was the adopted granddaughter of Julius Caesar). She was also Claudius and Nero's secretary Pallas and Vespasian's first cousin and mistress Antonia Caenis. "The full name of Pallas was Marcus Antonius Pallas, the Antonius part is an obvious sign of descent from Mark Antony and that Pallas wasn't a random slave. (Philo's hebrew name was Yedidia which means "beloved of God", or "friend of God", which is the same as Theophilos in Greek. Around 26% of the New Testament was written to Theophilus in Luke and Acts of the Apostles).

![Fig.
1.6](/images/AlexanderPhilo.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.6. (L) Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius
Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander the Alabarch aka
(King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of
Mauretania aka "Jesus" in the bible. (R) Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of
Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Pythodorida Philometor aka Helene aka
Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Alexandra bat Mattathias aka 'Philo of
Alexandria'.

Alexander (grandson of King Herod) and his sister-wife Cleopatra (Thea
Philopator) of Mauretania had two sons: Tiberius Julius Alexander aka
Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys (In
Thracian, 'Cotys' is related to the word 'kotys' which is a title that
means 'lord') aka Emperor Nerva, and Marcus Julius Alexander aka Yeshua
Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ma'nu of
Adiabene/Edessa aka Ptolemy aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy aka Izates aka Jesus
Emmanuel aka Monobazus of Adiabene [^8]

![Fig.
1.7](/images/Josephus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.7. 'Josephus' bust which I identify as
Tiberius Julius Alexander. Compare it to Nerva's depictions. So, 'Josephus' was Philo of Alexandria's son. Tiberius Julius Alexander's son was named 'Philopappos' and one of his mother's aliases was 'Alexandria bat Matthias' which is where the pseudonym 'Joseph bar Matthias' comes from. Also, drop the initial b and final s in the name "Bar Mathias" and you get (Joseph of) Arimathea.

![Fig. 1.8](/images/coin-abgar-phraates.png){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.8. (L) and (R) show King Izates Monobazus of Edessa (known in
Greek as the "Kingdom of Ourania" or in English as the "Kingdom of
Heaven") wearing a crown of thorns. Izates or Izas is his title which is
an ancient Greek translation of the Avestan word Yazatas (Persian:
izad), meaning 'lord'. He is one of the Jesus avatars, Isa in the Quran,
and Sultan Ezid in the Yazadi ('Iza'di) religion. He was the uncle of
Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus. The middle image
source: The Alexander Mosaic, Huqoq, Israel.

![Fig.1.9](/images/SauromatesII.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.9. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II, King of Bosphorus, who was the
son of Tiberius Julius Cotys (aka Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius
Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Emperor Nerva), great-grandson of
Dynamis aka Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Does he look familiar? ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC
CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ in the above coin translates to "King of the Sauromatians".
Sauromates is a Greek rendering of 'Sarmatian', referring to the Scythian
tribe who came from the Pontic steppe. 'Saur' means 'lizard' or
'reptile', and 'mates' means 'man' or 'warrior'. Therefore, translated
literallly ΒΑCΙΛΕΩC CΑVΡΟΜΑΤΟΥ means "King of the lizard people", or
"king of the reptile people". The Sarmatians were known for their use of
scale armor, and this is where the reference comes from.

One name that shows up in the family trees of all the people listed
above is Simon Boethus who I identify as (king/Tetrarch) Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus aka Simon Magus. The name Boethus comes from
Sabazios which is a translation of Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) in the
dialect and tradition of Phrygians and Thracians of Anatolia. Ma'nu is
likely a diminutive of Menneus ('son of man') and then Manu-Sabazios
becomes Monobazus which becomes 'Bazus' or 'Bar Izates' shortened to
'baYZTus' (or bar YZT) through frequent oral repetition which becomes
'bOETHus'. He was likely also Simon the Essene the founder of the Essene
sect and Simon Peter in the bible (the term 'Peter' is derived from the
Latin 'Pater' meaning 'father', denoting the Essene High Priest. The
Essenes called themselves 'the Sons of Zadok' and Simon was the heir of
the Zadokite High Priest dynasty). His daughter Mariamne Boethus was the
fifth wife of King Herod. He was the uncle of Jesus ben Fabus,
great-great-great-grandfather of Jesus ben Gamla/Gamaliel aka King Izas
Monobazus (the Talmud (Bereshit Rabbah 46:10) calls Izates and Monobazus
the 'Sons of Ptolemy'), and I identify Juba II as Alexander (son of King
Herod) which makes him the grandson of Simon Boethus, and he was the
great-great-grandfather of Vespasian.

Sabazius is related to the Saba/Sheba root meaning seven, rest, sated
etc., and Jupiter-Sabazius is a Semitic or Semitized form of Jupiter,
i.e. Turkish Judaism (the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius
(Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6)). Also, I(J)upiter was also called Jove or Iove
to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way,
i.e Yahweh/Yhwh, so Jove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus) became
conflated with Yahweh Saboath the god of the hebrew bible. Also, from
Sabazios you get Zebedaios, sons of Zebedee.

Ptolemy Menneus/Simon Boethus's son was named Philippion who I believe
is a good candidate for Philip II Philoromaios and also Tiridates II of
Parthia or Arsaces Philoromaios. Arsaces was the brother of Dynamis
[^9]. So, Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus, et.al.,
were the aliases of Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt, and Marriamme
Boethus was another of Cleopatra's regional aliases?  If you identify
King Herod as Mark Antony aka Tiberius Claudius Nero aka Phraates IV of
Parthia's regional alias then the picture becomes clearer.

The connection between Simon Boethus/Magus/Ptolemy X Alexander I/Ptolemy
(Alexander) bar Menneus and Julius Caesar is obviously through his
daughter Cleopatra whom Julius Caesar/Asander married. Using Josephus as
a source, Antipater the Idumean's son King Herod was married to Simon
Boethus's daughter Mariamme and Antipater the Idumean saved Julius
Caesar's life during the Battle of the Nile (47 BC). As a reward,
Josephus claims that Julius Caesar adopted King Herod's sons (Simon
Boethus's grandsons) Aristobulus IV (Vespasian's grandfather [^10],
Alexander (son of king Herod) aka Alexandros III aka Juba II, Herod
Antipas the Tetrarch, Archelaus, and Philip and raised them in Rome, in
the household of Gaius Asinius Pollio which was the same household that
Caesar Augustus was raised in (Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book
15, Chapter 2. Josephus, "Antiquities of the Jews", Book 17). This is
untrue and those kids were his biological sons. It is also untrue that
Alexander, son of King Herod, was killed by his father Herod, Josephus
even has a story about a 'spurious Alexander' that showed up in Rome
claiming to be the son of Herod who faked his death [^11], so he was
'resurrected' as Juba II, king of Numidia and Mauretania. 

Endnotes (Chapter 2)

(a) Amyntas Nikator aka Amyntas of Galatia aka Jesus ben Fabus aka Isa Amen (Jesus Amen of Rev. iii. 14) is an interesting figure. Historian Ranajit Pal has made the claim that Alexander the Great = Chandragupta Maurya (Alakshandra is a Sanskritized
    translation of Alexander and Gupta means guardian or protector in
    Sanskrit, the exact meaning of Alexander) who was an Indian emperor who founded the Mauryan Empire, one of the largest and most powerful empires in ancient India. (See: "Alexander and
    Chandragupta in Sanskrit Drama" by Ranajit Pal
    https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA
    [[link](https://www.academia.edu/40074507/ALEXANDER_AND_CHANDRAGUPTA_IN_A_SANSKRIT_DRAMA)]). He also claims that Diodotus I Soter (Alexander's successor to eastern territories) = Ashoka the Great (Chandragupta's successor). (See: "Diodotus I was Ashoka"
    by Ranajit Pal
    https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi
    [[link](https://www.academia.edu/695219/Diodotus_I_was_Ashoka_An_Altar_of_Alexander_Now_Standing_Near_Delhi)]). This would mean that Alexander completed his conquest of India and then adopted a local identity. So, India was under Greek rule since Alexander. Being the king of a region populated by Gauls, Amyntas of Galatia's religion would have been Druidism. The ancient Vedas are just the eastern branch of Druidism (https://www.academia.edu/13113385/Druidism_and_Vedism_Compared). The name Abaris or Abharas, from Abaris the Hyperborian, the Druid teacher of Pythagoras, derives from the Old Irish word abhar, which means chief or noble and was a generic term for Druid or Chief Druid. Abharas is also related to the Sanskrit word Bhārata, a legendary king in the Vedas. Bhārata is at the root of the word Bharatvarsha which is a term that is used to refer to the Indian subcontinent as a whole. 

(b) Suetonius (Divus Julius 88) notes Caesar's comet or 'Julian Star'
    (or Sidus Iulium) rose during his funeral games, interpreted as his
    soul's ascent---eerily similar to Christ's resurrection narrative.

(c) Apollonius of Tyre was married to the daughter of a king of Libya ("Historia Apollonii Regis Tyri" or "The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre"), who was Cleopatra Selene aka Drusilla (aka Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria. Drusilla was the wife of Azizus who was her brother Juba II (Alexander Helios aka Alexander (son of King Herod)) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania aka Phraates V (the “King of Kings”) aka Monobazus I King of Adiabene).\
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Tyre_(philosopher)\
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Tyre\
So, Alexander aka Juba II was also Apollonius of Tyre. Juba II carried the title "Rex Literatissimus" which can be translated as "Most Learned King" or "The Most Scholarly King". He was known as a philosopher. Is Apollonius of Tyre the same person as Apollonius of Tyana? This would make Apollonius of Tyana the brother-husband of Philo of Alexandria and the father of Josephus. These three created the core of Christianity.

(d) Gautama Buddha was Gaumata Bardya, the son of Cyrus the Great. Ptolemy I Soter and his successors were closely associated with Serapis. "Jesus" was an avatar for the Bosphioran royal family. Apollonius of Tyana was king Juba II, the grandson of Julius Caesar/Asander and Cleopatra/Dynamis. All these aristocrats/kings took on religious personas and preached syncretic versions of Greco-Buddhism to the public: monotheism, renounce worldy possessions, asceticism, shame and guilt, you will be rewarded in the afterlife for your earthly suffering, etc. These cults were by design slave moralities to strip the will to power from the population to prevent rebellions. 
    
#### 3 Rome on the Bosphorus?

My research on the origins of Christianity takes me to the Bosphorus
river in classical Anatolia (Julius Caesar = Asander, King of Bosphorus,
and Cleopatra = Dynamis). This is incongruent with mainstream history.
However, there are a few revisionist authors such as Anatoly Fomenko and
Gunnar Heinsohn who make the claim that the Western Roman Empire is a
duplicate of the Eastern Roman Empire not the other way around and that
much of the history of the Western Roman Empire was conjured up by the
Church Fathers, Jesuits, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and medieval forgers,
either to retrofit history to align with the Bible, due to conflicts
between the Vatican and the Eastern Byzantine Church, or for profit.

The area of modern-day Istanbul was once called 'Basileía tôn Rhômaíôn'
('Kingdom of the Romans') and the people of that region called
themselves Rhōmaîoi (Romans). Historians assume that region got it's
name after Roman colonization, but why? Every romance language based on
Latin underwent a linguistic evolution except Romanian, which is the
closest language to classical Latin. Could it be that the original
Romans hailed from Romania and then moved south to Anatolia? A
substantial part of Byzantine coinage from two millennia ago boasts
inscriptions in Latin and not in Greek, including the Asander of
Bosphorus coin in Fig. 1.1.

There is genetic and historical evidence proving the Rome on the
Bosphorus theory. Rome was founded by Italic tribes of "Indo-Europeans".
However, this is where academic definitions fail because those founders
of Rome were actually 85%+ Anatolian Early European Farmer (EAF). The
Etruscans who established Rome were invaders from Anatolia, and the
Carians who hailed from southwest Anatolia have a strong connection with
the settlement of Rome (Aquilla = Qos = god of Kos of Caria).

Endnotes (Chapter 3)

(a) Asander and Dynamis had one known son, Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios. He was born about the same time as "Caesarion" and "Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar". His wife, known only through numismatic evidence, was Gepae-pyris. Tiberius and Gepaepyris had two sons; the eldest was "Tiberius Julius Mithridates Philo-Germanicus Philopatris" ("son of Mithra, lover of Germanicus, lover of father"). Their second son was "Tiberius Julius Cotys I Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes" ("lover of Caesar, lover of Rome who is the Pious One").

Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios (son). Married to: Gepae-pyris. Children:\
        Tiberius Julius Mithridates Philo-Germanicus Philopatris (eldest son)\
        Tiberius Julius Cotys I Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes (second son)

Now, let's connect this family to the Roman Emperor's family:

Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar\
        Adopted son and heir: Germanicus\
        Biological son: Drusus

Tiberius Julius Aspurgus Philoromaios and Emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar were born around the same time, and their sons were also born around the same time.

Also, Polemon Pythodoros (Julius Caesar/Asander) and Pythodorida of Pontus (Cleopatra/Dynamis) had a daughter Antonia Tryphaena. Her son was Rhoemetalces II whose reign coincided with emperor Claudius.

Emperor Titus = Polemon II of Pontus who was the prince of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cilicia, and Cappadocia.

I asked ChatGPT to translate Roman emperor names and Bosphorian princes and kings names into Celtic (the Galatians were Gauls), Latin, and Etruscan and try to find the Roman emperor identities among the Bosphoran elite. This is the result:

-Augustus: The Celtic name "Ogur" or "Augus" could be transliterated to the Etruscan name "Avile" or "Aule", which means "great" or "magnificent". The Etruscan name "Avile" is similar to the Latin name "Augustus". Aspourgos, a king of the Bosphorus, has a similar name meaning, with the Greek name "Aspourgos" being similar to the Etruscan name "Avile". The Phoenician name "Asgar" or "Asgaros" could also be related, meaning "great leader" or "king". The Celtic name "Augus" could also mean "lord" or "master", similar to the Etruscan name "Avile".\
-Tiberius: Tiberius means "of the Tiber" in Latin. The Bosphorus has a river called the Thibaris, which might be connected to the name Tiberius. A possible match is Tiberius Julius Aspurgus, a king of the Bosphorus, who ruled from 8 BC to 38 AD. His birth date is unknown, but his reign overlaps with Tiberius' (14 - 37 AD). The Celtic word "tibor" means "lord" or "master", which could be related to the name Tiberius. The Bosphorian king Tiberius Julius Aspurgus has a name that combines Latin and Celtic elements. The Celtic name "Tigernach" means "lord" or "master", which could be transliterated to "Tiberius". The Thracian name "Tiberios" or "Tiberos" could also be related, meaning "lord" or "master".\
-Caligula: The Celtic name "Caulgach" could be transliterated to the Etruscan name "Kalikle" or "Kalike", which means "warrior" or "soldier". The Etruscan name "Kalikle" is similar to the Latin name "Caligula". Cotys I, a king of the Bosphorus, has a name that means "warrior" or "soldier" in Greek, with the Celtic name "Cotys" being similar to the Etruscan name "Kalikle". The Illyrian name "Kalikos" or "Kalikus" could also be related, meaning "strong" or "powerful".\
-Claudius: The Celtic name "Cladach" could be transliterated to the Etruscan name "Klute" or "Kluti", which means "shore" or "beach". The Etruscan name "Klute" is similar to the Latin name "Claudius". Mithridates III, a king of the Bosphorus, has a name that means "great warrior" in Greek, with the Celtic name "Mithrid" being similar to the Etruscan name "Klute". The Scythian name "Klutos" or "Klutus" could also be related, meaning "glorious" or "famous". Lord is found in the Celtic translation of "Cladach" as "lord of the shore". \
-Nero: The Celtic name "Nerach" could be transliterated to the Etruscan name "Nerke" or "Nerki", which means "strong" or "powerful". The Etruscan name "Nerke" is similar to the Latin name "Nero". Tiberius Julius Cotys II, a king of the Bosphorus, has a name that combines Latin and Celtic elements, with the Greek name "Cotys" being similar to the Etruscan name "Nerke". The Germanic name "Nerikos" or "Nerikus" could also be related, meaning "strong" or "powerful".\
-Vespasian: The Celtic name "Vespag" could be transliterated to the Etruscan name "Vespe" or "Vespi", which means "wasp" or "stinging insect". The Etruscan name "Vespe" is similar to the Latin name "Vespasian". Rhescuporis, a king of the Bosphorus, has a name that means "he who is stung" in Greek, with the Celtic name "Rhescu" being similar to the Etruscan name "Vespe". The Phoenician name "Vespas" or "Vespasos" could also be related, meaning "wasp" or "stinging insect". Lord is found in the Celtic translation of "Vespag" as "lord of the wasps".\
-Domitian: The Celtic name "Domnach" could be transliterated to the Etruscan name "Dumne" or "Dumni", which means "lord" or "master". The Etruscan name "Dumne" is similar to the Latin name "Domitian". Sauromates I, a king of the Bosphorus, has a name that means "ruler of the land" or "lord of the earth" in Greek, with the Celtic name "Domnach" being similar to the Etruscan name "Dumne". The Thracian name "Dom

#### 4 Flavian Dynasty \

Vespassian was also a great-grandson of Cleopatra and Mark Antony (King Herod). He was Herod Pollio aka Herod Agrippa I, grandson of King Herod's son Aristobulus IV. Vespasian was his title, not his name (Vas/Bas was the royal abbreviation for the Greek word Basilius which = King, and Pasius = Peace. 'Vespasian' = 'King Peace') [^12]. He was also 'Flavius Scaevinus' the conspirator who was involved in Nero's assassination. 

![Fig.

Fig. 1.10. Compare Vespasian's depiction to Herod Agrippa I

'Antonia Caenis' was Vespassian's mistress who was his first cousin who was Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria. (Caenis was the Greek goddess who was transformed into a man, and she role-played as two men: Marcus Antonius Pallas and Philo).

Cleopatra (Thea Philopator) of Mauretania aka Cleopatra IX aka Helene aka Drusilla of Mauretania aka Julia Ourania of Parthia aka Philo of Alexandria aka Antonia Caenis's son was Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Josephus who was the Prefect (leader) of the
Praetorian Guard which made him arguably the most powerful man in the empire during Vespasian's reign.

Vespasian's son Titus was in a relationship with his aunt Berenice, granddaughter of King Herod, who was St. Veronica in the bible (Veronica is a transliteration of the Greek name Berenike meaning 'victory').

Berenice's brother Marcus Julius Agrippa II, whom she was in an incestuous relationship with before moving on to her nephew (previous to this she was married to her uncle Herod of Chalcis), was the governor of all foreign Roman territories except Egypt (which was governed by Tiberius Julius Alexander) during the Flavian period.

Emperor Vitellius was probably an alias for Vespasian's older brother
Titus Flavius Sabinus who was married to Mariamne III aka "Arria the
Elder" ("Arria" from her father's name judean king Aristobulus IV who
was the son of King Herod and he was also Julius Caesar's adopted son.
Aristobulus IV was likely Vespasian and Vitellius's father, so like his
cousin Alexander (grandson of King Herod), he was also married to his
sister). 

Endnotes (Chapter 4)

(a) Theory: Alexander (grandson of King Herod) aka Gaius Julius Alexander, Herodian Prince of Judaea aka Alexander Lysimachus aka Alexander the Alabarch aka Tiberius Julius Alexander Major aka (King/Tetrarch) Ptolemy (Alexander) bar Menneus aka Ptolemy of Mauretania was also the Roman general 'Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo'. Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo conquered Armenia alongside Tiberius Julius Alexander (his son Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Arrius Calpernius Piso aka Arrius Varus aka Tiberius Julius Cotys aka Emperor Nerva), after which, Tigranes VI (Tiberius Julius Alexander) was installed as king. Compare his bust [link] to the famous 'Josephus' (Tiberius Julius Alexander) bust [link]. Notice a resemblance? If this is correct, then he (Alexander) would have been the brother-in-law to Caligula and father-in-law to Domitian. Tiridates of Armenia (who would have been Mithridates Chrestus' great-great-grandson) was the one who spread the religion Mithraism which was a syncretic a slave-morality religion to subjugate the Parthians. Mithras is inspired by Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It’s a solar son deity, a Jupiter. 

#### 5 Julius Caesar was a Title 

Identifying Julius Caesar as Asander of Bosphorus necessitates a re-examination of his name. 

Galata in Classical Anatolia was settled by the Gauls. Galatia bordered
the Bosphorus, and Julius Caesar/Asander was king of this region. The
king of Galatia during this time was Asander's brother-in-law Amyntas of
Galatia who ruled an area that stretched into India under the alias
Amyntas Nikator.

"Gaius" then can refer to Asander's connection to the Gallian (Gauls (Galli = Celt in Latin))  people or his ancestry in the region.

Ceasar's gentilice (surname) was Iulius. Iulius can refer to the ancient Celtic tribe known as the Iudii or Iudaei. "Ioulios" (ιούλιος) in Greek also means "descended from Jupiter" or "son of Jupiter". So, it is possible that the word "jew" comes from the Iudii or Iudaei.
 
Caesarus referred to a Celtic chieftain. For example, Caesorix was the leader of the Cimbri tribe during the Cimbrian War.

Gaius Julius Caesar was a title, and Gaius Julius Caesar could conceivably translate to: Chieftain of the Iudii or Iudaiei tribe from Galatia.

I(J)upiter was called Jove or Iove to the Romans. The Latin pronunciation of Iove would have been Yoh-Way, i.e., Yahweh/Yhwh, so Yahweh Saboath, the god of the hebrew bible, is I(J)ove (Roman Zeus) Sabazios (Thracian Zeus).

'Ashkenazi', or 'Ashkuza', was the name given to the Scythians by the ancient Akkadians (Josephus. Vol. 5: Antiquities: 8:2:5, pp. 593-595). The Assyrians called the Scythians "Asguzaya" and the ancient Persians called the Scythians 'Saka'. In Biblical Hebrew, the Ashkuz (Ashkenaz) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the Gimirri, known as the Cimmerians to the ancient Greeks. Cimmerians were a Middle Eastern offshoot of the Celtic Cimbri tribe. The Bosphorus Kingdom that Asander ruled over was also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosphorus.

As for the term 'Hebrew", it comes from the Celts as well, who called themselves
Iberi. The name of Abaris the Hyperborean, a Druid priest who was
Pythagoras's teacher shows this. Iber was sometimes
rendered as Aber or Heber and is pronounced as Hebrew in the Hebrew
languages. Hyperborea, which just like Atlantis, was another name for
Ireland. The word Atlantis means 'The Island of Atlas'. The titan Atlas
was a key figure in Greek mythology and is depicted as being the bearer
of the heavens. According to early Greek mythology, Atlas lived on the
island of Hyperborea. Over time Hyperborea became Hybernia or Hibernia,
the Roman name for Ireland. Iber is an ethnonym that shows up in areas
where the Celtic people settled (Ebro river, Iberia, Hibernia, etc.).

Abel and Cain are just a copy of Romulus and Remus. Judas Iscariot is a copy of Brutus. Genesis 4:5-31. Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah, Lamech, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, are copies of Titus Livy's Regal Rome of the seven kings.

Also, Caesar, Kaiser (German for Caesar), Kesar or Kaysar (Persian for Caesar), Kaisar (Ancient Greek for Caesar), Tsar (Russian for Caesar) and Khazar are not just phonetic coincidences. It all ties back to the Divine Julius cult.

So, it seems that the Romans (in Anatolia) tried to assimilate the tribe that became modern jews by forcing their imperial cult on them and they got their identity from here. This is why several prominent members of this royal family identified as "Jews" despite being Aryan Sarmatians and Celtic Galatians.

#### 6 Esus the Celtic Deity

The Celts in classical Galatia worshiped a deity called Hesus/Esus/Iesus. The Celtic name Esus is believed to be related to the Proto-Celtic word "aisu", which means "lord" or "master". The letter "J" was invented in the 17th century, so the name "Jesus" would have been "Esus" in the classical sense. 

Futhermore, in the name Asander, "Asa" means "lord" in Thracian, and "andros" means "man" or "son of man" in Greek. Jesus is refered to as "the son of man" 81 times in the four canonical gospels. Asandro can also be interpreted as "son of the lord" or "son of Asa, the lord". The Thracian version of Zeus was Asa/Asaeus and the Celtic version of Zeus was Esus. So, Asandro could be interpreted as "son of Lord Esus". Another way of getting the name Esus from Asandros is if we translate "Asander" from Ancient Thracian to Gaulish and we might get a name that conveys a similar meaning to Esunertos (Lord Esus).

Esus/Hesus/Iesus then eventually phonetically shifted to I-zas/Izas/Izates.

![Fig.
1.11](/images/Esus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.11. Statue from classical Anatolia that is dedicated to "Esumopas Cnusticus". Esumopas means "Slave to Esus", and Esus means lord in Proto-Celtic. If you combine the Etruscan word "cnus" with the suffix "-ticus" or "-tic-" you get a word that translates to "anointed one" or "consecrated one", ie. a "Christ". So, that inscription translates to: "Slave to Lord (Esus) Christ". The "VSLM" inscription is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase "Votum Solvit Libens Merito" which translates to "He pays his vow willingly and with merit" or "He fulfills his vow with pleasure and deserving", which is often found on Roman coins and other artifacts. Esus was crucified in mythology and his symbol was an axe, so he was associated with woodcutting, forestry, carpentry.

#### 7 Subversion of the Imperial Cult

Sometime after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), a group of rabbis
that were headed by a rabbi named Akiva who led the Talmudic Pharisees
and is responsible for large parts of the Talmud, Sefer Yetzirah (book
of creation), the Mishna and the Midrash Halakha, and modern judaism,
and who was a student of Gamaliel (Paul the Apostle claimed that he was
brought up in Jerusalem "at the feet of Gamaliel" (Acts 22:3)), and who
was the one that came up with the idea that "Rome was Edom", realized
that subversion was the only way to defeat the Romans. So, rabbi Akiva
and his students Aquila of Sinope aka Onkelos, Markianos of Alexandria
aka Marcion (Greek Markion) of Sinope, Shimon bar Yohai aka Simon Peter (Shimon bar Yonah) (Simon's mythology was stolen from the Roman deity Janus who was the keeper of keys/gatekeeper role. Eusebius reported that Philo had met Simon Peter in Rome), Ketia bar Shalom aka 'Clement of Rome' (hebrew Ketia is the same as Latin Clement), Aristo of Pella who is a good candidate for being Luke the Evangelist ('Aristo', or 'Ariston' is a name that is related to 'Proteus' The former means 'first-rank, noble' the second derives from 'first'. So, was he also Peregrinus Proteus? Also, Mark or
Mahalia, sixteenth bishop of Jerusalem was the secretary of Aristo and Marcion is known to have had a disciple named Lucanus as documented by Tertullian, so Mark, or Mahalia, first Gentile bishop of Jerusalem was also Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope?), Rabbi Yehuda aka Jude the Apostle (Yehuda is the Hebrew equivalent of Greek Jude), and Rabbi Meir aka Polycarp aka Bishop ignatius (the name "Meir" means "one who illuminates". Ignatius means firey one and Polycarp was famous for lighting himself on fire), added a slave-morality suicide cult to the imperial cult.

Many of rabbi Akiva's students and contemporaries had connections to the
Alexandrian School in Egypt and were themselves students of Philo of
Alexandria.

Rabbi Akiva was likely Paul the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 "Paul" claims to have been educated at the feet of Gamaliel who was the teacher of rabbi Akiva, and in Acts 18:2-3 and Romans 16:3 NASB, it is claimed that Aquila of Sinope and his wife Prisca or Priscilla lived with Paul the Apostle and Paul called them “my fellow workers in Christ Jesus. Paul's/Saul's fictional life story was stolen from the ancient Egyptian story "Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor". 

Quintus Tinnius Rufus (Turnus Rufus the Evil) was Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judaea who crucified Simon bar Kokhba and killed rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva preached that Simon bar Kokhba was the jewish messiah.

Esus then became Esau (Edom) the progenitor of the Edomites in the bible, a metaphor for the forces of oppression and injustice. The Jewish version of Antichrist (Armilus) is based on Romulus (Armilus is a Hebrew corruption or adaptation of the Latin name Romulus). The Greco-Egyptian deity Serapis (the horned deity) became Satan. Lucifer, or "lucem ferre", which means "light-bearer" or "morning star", is Venus who was the Roman goddess whose functions encompassed love, beauty, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas. Also, the jews' hated enemy in the bible are the Celts (Gog or Goy). Flavius Josephus in the 'Antiquities of the Jews'. Book I. Chapter 1: "For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians [Galls], but were then called Gomerites. Magog founded those that from him were named Magogites; but who are by the Greeks called Scythians". Josephus is suggesting that the Hebrew word "Goy" (meaning "nation" or "people") is related to the Greek word "Galatae" (meaning "Gauls" or "Galatians"), In biblical prophecy, Gog is described as a leader from the land of Magog in the north, who will gather a coalition of nations to attack Israel, but will be defeated by God in a great battle.

![Fig.
1.12](/images/Romulus.jpg){:width="400px"}

Fig. 1.12. Quirinus who was the deified Romulus, who in Roman mythology was the founder and first king of Rome. Romulus (Armilus) is the jewish antichrist. A link can be established between Quirinus and Esus. In Proto-Celtic, the word "Kwerynos" means "lord" exactly like Kyrios in ancient Greek, and is related to the Etruscan "Kuris" and the Roman "Quirinus". Quirinus then can potentially translate to "Deified Lord" or "Lord Esus" in the context of Celtic and Etruscan mythology. In Plutarch’s biography of Romulus we are told he was the son of god, born of a virgin (Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin); an attempt is made to kill him as a baby, and he is saved, and raised by a poor family, becoming a lowly shepherd; then as a man he becomes beloved by the people, hailed as king, and killed by the conniving elite; then he rises from the dead, appears to a friend to tell the good news to his people, and ascends to heaven to rule from on high. Just like Esus and Jesus.   

So, Talmudic jews who were hiding out in the Himyarite Kingdom after Emperor
Hadrian kicked them out of judea basically just cut-and-pasted from one of the Bosphoran/Roman imperial cults of the time and infused a slave morality into it. Getting people to abandon their religons for a new one is an almost impossible task, so instead, through religious syncretism and intertextuality, creating a new sect of an established religion makes it easier for a population to adapt. Julius Caesar aka Asander of Bosphorus or one of his successors in the Bosphoran imperial cult (King Izates Monobazus or Tiberius Julius Sauromates II) was replaced with Simon bar Kokhba. This became modern Christianity.

This conspiracy was so sophisticated that not only did they rewrite the imperial cult, but they rewrote history to align with their psy-op. Josephus's (Tiberius Julius Alexander aka Emperor Nerva) works were rewritten by Rabbi Akiva's students under the alias Hegesippus. The book 'The Antiquities of the
Jews' then became a pseudo-epigraphical work (of propaganda) that was backdated to make christianity look legitimate in the same way that the 'Letter of Aristeas' was backdated to exaggerate the age of the Septuagint. I would even hazard a guess that this group was responsible for burining down the Library of Alexandria which resulted
in the loss of all recorded history up until that point so that they
could cover up the tracks of their psy-op religion.


Endnotes (Chapter 7)

(a) Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria grew up in the Attis-Sabazios cult on Anatolia before traveling to Judea to study under rabbi Akiva and finally to Alexandria at the Alexandrian School.

(b) There was a Marcus who founded the Marcosian Gnostic sect. He was a teacher of Bishop Irenaeus and a friend of Clement of Alexandria. Was he also Marcion of Sinope aka Markianos of Alexandria? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_%28Marcosian%29). St. Jerome in "Against Jovinian" describes Mark as a disciple of the Gnostic teacher Basilides. Here is a list of "Marks" who were active around the same time: Mark, the Evangelist, John Mark, Mark of Apollonias, Markianos of Alexandria, Mahalia, Marcus of Jerusalem, Marcus Pompeius, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, Marcus the Magician, Marcion of Sinope, Marcus the Marcosian. Mark of Apollonias, John Mark, Mark the cousin of Barnabas, and Mark the Apostle are considered to be the same person by historians, so it is conceivable that all these "Marks" were the same person.

(c) Yohai is a nickname for Yochai. The name Yochai means 'YHWAH is gracious' from the Hebrew word Yochanan sometimes transcribed as Johanan. Was he also Johanan the Alexandrian? This would place him in Alexandria at the same time as Markianos of Alexandria.

(d) Quintus Tineius Sacerdos, the brother of Quintus Tinnius Rufus, was the governor of Pontus in Anatolia, so the family likely derived from there. Pilate means the temperament of a warrior I.e., famously temperamental. That's where the name Pontius Pilate comes from.

(e) Many of these jewish rabbis align with prominent Roman figures. Is it because the term "Jew" referred to the Celtic Iudii or Iudaei tribe at the time and the people that became modern jews stole their identity from here, or were the Romans attempting to subvert these people?


-Rabbi Akiva (c. 50–135) = Epictetus (c. 50–135)? Epictetus was the slave to Nero's scribe Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus or Epaphroditos (c. 20–25 – died c. 95). Epictetus had a Roman teacher named Gaius Musonius Rufus (c. 20-30-died c. 101) who was a Roman Stoic philosopher. Gaius Musonius Rufus was also a teacher of Dio Chrysostom (c. 40 – c. 115 AD). Josephus opened his book "Jewish Wars" and "History of the Jews" (Antiquities) by addressing them to: "kratistos (most excellent) Epaphroditus". Epictetus had a hand in writing the new testament (See: "Epictetus and the New Testament" by Douglas Simmonds Sharp (1914)). Epicteus and Pilny the Younger were both in the same places at the same time; Rome, Nicopolis, and Bithynia-Pontus, and Pliny the Younger was a Roman administrator in Bithynia and Pontus at the same time Marcion was in Sinope.

-Gamaliel/St. Gamaliel (Paul's teacher) = Tiberius Gemellus, grandson
    of Emperor Tiberius and a cousin of Emperor Caligula. (The Aramaic
    word Gemel means "twin", in Latin it is Gemellus, and in Hebrew it's
    Gamaliel). He was a student of Herod Agrippa who was King Herod's
    grandson (Antiquities of the Jews, Flavius Josephus. Chapter 6).
    Gamaliel was the father of Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben
    Sapphias who was also King Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of
    Adiabene.

-Bishop Ignatius of Antioch (-natius in Latin refers to "youth") = Pliny the Younger (Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus). He was also Polycarp (Ignatius means "fiery one" and Polycarp was famous for setting himself on fire). Likely also Paul the Apostle (either him or Rabbi Akiva (Epictetus)). He was also Pope Linus (just drop the P from his name Plinius).

-St. Peter = Publius Petronius (father-in-law of emperor Vitellius
    who I identify as Vespasian's older brother Titus Flavius Sabinus.
    
-Markianos of Alexandria aka Marcion of Sinope = Marcus Annaeus Lucanus who was a nephew and student of Seneca the Younger (Marcus Annaeus Mela was another nephew of Seneca the Yonger).

-One other student of rabbi Akiva was Ketia bar Shalom which was the jewish name of Titus
Flavian Clemens, who was the nephew of emperor Domitian. Titus
Flavian Clemens is a likely candidate for being 'Clement of Rome'. Rabbi
Akiva's other student was Rabbi Meir who the Talmud (Gittin 56a) claims
was a grandson of emperor Nero.

_Appendix A: The Symbol of the Cross_

The symbol of the cross, Celtic cross/high cross/sun cross/solar
    wheel, et.al., which predates christianity by thousands of years
    (Callanish Stones. Wikipedia,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones
    [[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callanish_Stones)]), was a
    prominent symbol in ancient Europe. The circle is a sunwheel that
    together with the cross served as a sundial that had markings to
    track the time, date, and lunar and agricultural cycles. Also, in
    portable form it was a sundial clock and compass. Although not a
    religious symbol, as they were astronomical tools, every city in
    ancient Europe would have had a large cross raised at its center in
    the same way that every city today has a clock tower at it's center.
    So you can see how christianity spread throughout Europe, through
    subversion. Most Europeans must have thought that christianity was
    simply the same relgion that they were already worshiping, and
    because of widespread illiteracy at the time, they had no idea what
    garbage was inside the bible.

_Appendix B: How did Christianity spread?_

Vespasian and his sons Titus and Domitian
brought 100,000 jewish "slaves" to Rome (Josephus, Jewish War vi, 9)
[^13]. It seems likely that the 100,000 jewish "slaves" joined the jews
that were already in Rome and they became the early church missionaries
and profited from selling this religion to the slaves and exploited
classes.

    language likely derives from the Dacian language which was spoken by
    the Thracians and Phrygians who hailed from the region of modern
    Romania. Also, the word Byzantine is a modern invention and the area
    of modern Byzantine (modern-day Istanbul) was once called "Basileía

    called themsevles Rhōmaîoi (Romans), and they hailed from Romania
    (meaning Romanus, or Roman). Most of the "new History" that we
    accept as fact today was created by the Church Fathers, Jesuits
    (including all non-European history), and Joseph Justus Scaliger.
    --Sir Isaac Newton, in his book "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
    Amended" (1728), claimed that 711 years were added to our calender,
    and that history was retrofitted to the bible. Anatoly Fomenko
    increased this number to 1000 years in his books. Anatoly Fomenko
    claims that all of chronology rests on one guy, Joseph Scaliger
    (Scaligerian Chronology), the same guy is credited with re-descovery
    of 80% of the ancient authors and literature, most of the time on
    demand. Anatoly Fomenko also makes several other controversial
    claims in his work, specifically that Charlemagne was not a real
    person, but one of the phantom individuals Catholic Church made up
    to fill in their phantom 1000 years and Charlemagne is based on a
    real-life man known as Odoacer. Plato and Gemistus Plethon were one
    and the same person. Genghis Khan and Attila The Hun were the same
    person. The Black Plague / Great Plague / Black Death / Bubonic
    Plague (it's a copy to fill in the phantom 1000 years of supposed
    "Dark Ages") is exactly the same event as the Justinian Plague. The
    Trojan War and the Crusades were the same conflict. Also, that there
    were multiple "Romes" and the major one was based out of Anatolia,
    in an area that is modern Istanbul. The last point I independently
    confirmed. Julius Caesar = Asander of Bosphorus, and all early
    Christianity traces back to to the Bosphorus.

[^2]: Julius Caesar was his title (Caesar is etymologically similar to
    the Indo-Aryan word for "king" and Julius (Iulius) is similar to
    both (I)Jupiter and to the Indo-Aryan word for "sun"). Julius Caesar
    was deified in two religions: in the Flamen Dialis cult (Dialis is
    related to Diespiter, an Old Latin form of the name Jupiter) which
    made him the claimed son of (I)Jupiter (There was no letter J in
    Latin and (I)Jupiter is the Roman equivalent of Zeus and they both
    derive from the Aryan allfather Dyeus Pter which translates to Sky
    Father. The name Zeus comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus", and
    (I)Jupiter comes from the pronunciation of "Dyeus Pter" ->
    Diespiter -> Iupiter), and he was deified posthumously in the Divus
    Iulius cult (Divus is synonymous to Dyeus, and as aforemented,
    Iulius derives from (I)Jupiter). He had a claimed divine birth, was
    put on trial, betrayed, sacrificed, and was a pontifex maximus (high
    priest) in his religion.
    --A statue from the Bosporan Kingdom, dated to Asander's reign (ca.
    47--17 BCE) refers to Asander/Asandros as Asandros Philoromaios
    Soter and gives him the title "King of Kings". So he was a
    "Soter"/Christ. Source: Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani (CIRB

    Dynamis carried the title Ouriana, refering to Aphrodite Urania
    ("heavenly Aphrodite"), the Greek godess. Cleopatra also depicted
    herself as Aphrodite. Cleopatra's daughter Cleopatra Selene II was
    also Queen Thea Muse Ourania.

[^5]: His name alludes to the Mithras cult. Mithraism was spread by
    Tiridates of Armenia (alias of Alexander, grandson of King Herod,
    Mithridates Chrestus descendant?) after Rome's defeat of Parthia
    around 53 AD as a slave-morality religion to subjugate the
    Parthians. Mithras is inspired from Zoroastrianism, the religion of
    the Persians/Parthians, but Mithras is the same as Sabazios. It's a
    solar son deity, a Jupiter (Mithridates Chrestus's descendant
    carried the title Monobazus aka Manu-Sabazios). The Mithras cult has
    many similarities to Christianity; Mithras was born of a virgin,
    Mithras' birth was celebrated on December 25, Mithras was considered
    a savior and redeemer, etc., although all these traits are "de jure"
    of saviors in ancient religions, probably because they all came from
    the "Alexandrian School" in Egypt. The Serapis cult, Gnosticism,
    Valentinianism, Christianity, Hermeticism, Mithraism, Manichaeism,
    Mandaeism, and many other religions came from the Alexandrian
    School. The Sibylline Oracles were the blueprint for these
    religions./

[^6]: Jesus ben Fabus who was Isa Amen (Jesus Amen) of Rev. iii. 14 who
    was also Amyntas (Amen(tas)) of Galatia who was also Amyntas Nikator
    (the name Fabus may have been distorted by Josephus from Jesus ben
    Bagus. Amyntas was the son of Bogitarus. In Persian "Bagus" means
    god. "Boga" in Persian also means god and in the name Adobogiona
    "Bog-" means god in Celtic. In Latin Nikator translates tro
    Invictus). His palace at Iśauria reveals his name as Iśa. (See:
    Jesus Christ Was Amyntas of Galatia (2010) by Ranajit Pal

[^7]: The name Herod likely derives from the amalgamation of Horus and
    Hercules (Herakles in Greek). Mark Antony claimed descent from
    Hercules and declared himself an incarnation of Horus. Herod became
    king of judaea around the time of Mark Antony's "suicide". This is
    typical for these elites, they would kill off one character and then
    assume another one in a different location as if they were actors in
    a play.\
    --The Shekel of Tyre that King Herod minted depicts Mark Antony and
    an image of Hercules:
    https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels
    [[link](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=tyrian%20shekels)].
    Herod also built a number of temples and shrines dedicated to
    Hercules, including one in Beirut and another in Tyre. He also
    depicted himself as Hercules in his Herodian Cult. King Herod's son,
    Herod Antipas, has the same name as Mark Antony's son, Antyllus,
    King Herod's other son Antipater was Iullus Antonius, Mark Antony's
    son with Fulvia. The wife of Iullus Antonius is called Marcella
    daughter of Octavian/Augustus' sister Octavia. Fulvia and Antony
    also are said to have had two daughters, Antonia I and Antonia II.
    Caligula and Claudius were descendants of Antonia I. Probably
    Antonia I and/or II was the sister of Herod the Great called Salome.
    Probably there is also a connection between "Costabar" husband of
    Salome and the Roman "Ahenobarbus" who married Antonia I.\
    --Mark Antony (King Herod) = Tiberius Claudius Nero. The way to make this
    connection is through the equivalence of Doris the first wife of
    Herod the Great and Livia Drusilla the second wife of
    Octavius/Caesar Augustus. Augustus was first married to Scribonia,
    but not happily. In 39 BC she gave birth to a daughter, Julia, but
    was divorced by Augustus. In the same year he became engaged to
    Livia Drusilla, who was at the time pregnant, not by Augustus but by
    her own first husband. That husband was Tiberius Claudius Nero,
    praetor of 41 BC and son of another Tiberius Claudius Nero, praetor
    of 62 BC. Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla's son was
    emperor Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus.

[^8]: Jesus ben Gamala/Gamaliel aka Jesus ben Sapphias was also King
    Izas Ma'nu (Jesus Emmanuel) Monobazus of Adiabene aka Yeshua
    Cleopatros (Cantheras/Panthera) ben Josephus bar Menneus aka Ptolemy
    aka Yakov Zu Tolomoy. (See: Jesus, King of Edessa (2012) by Ralph
    Ellis
    [[link](https://x.com/ralfellis/status/1809520320077803525)]).
    King Izates of Monobazus was married to the sister of Dynamis's
    mother.\
    --Cleopatros in Hebrew is QLPTRS and was shortened on
    inscriptions to QTRS or Katros, later mistakenly recorded as
    Cantheras. So the Jews for derogatory reasons called it as Panthera.
    ie. Jesus Panthera.
