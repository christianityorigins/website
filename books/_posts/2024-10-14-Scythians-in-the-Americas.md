**Prologue**

Our previous volumes traced the R1a/R1b Dragon Crown from its Pontic-Caspian heartland across Eurasia, establishing a theocratic-commercial empire whose veins were rivers and whose nerves were sailing routes. We proved its proxy rule over Egypt, Anatolia, Persia, and India. One question remained: did its dominion cross the Atlantic?

Conventional history screams "no." The evidence, when viewed without the blindfold of academic dogma, shouts "yes." This volume does not propose mere "contact." It documents the settlement, administration, and eventual catastrophic isolation of a transatlantic province—a province whose re-discovery in 1492 was not discovery, but reconnection.

The ocean was not a barrier. It was a controlled canal.

**Introduction**

Recap from books one and two: All Chronology is False: The Julian/Gregorian calendar, dynastic lists, and "ancient" texts are post-15th century constructs designed to create a linear, biblical, and Europe-centric past. The "Phantom Time" hypothesis (Fomenko et al.) is a conservative estimate; the forgery is more total.

All "Ancient" Physical Evidence is Suspect: The corpus of "Roman" and "Greek" sculpture, coinage, and inscriptions was largely manufactured during the Renaissance and Enlightenment by networks connected to the Medici, Vatican, and later, northern European antiquities markets. Authentic artifacts from pre-1500 exist, but their provenance and dating are unreliable.

The historical record as we know it was systematically forged in three major phases:

1. The Flavian Revolution (1st century CE): After crushing the legitimate Dragon King dynasty based in the Bosporus, the Flavian dynasty burned the Library of Alexandria, rewrote history, and invented the foundational myths of Western civilization.

2. The Vatican-Medici Forgery (14th-18th centuries): From roughly 600–1200 CE almost all ancient texts survive only via monasteries. The Vatican, in conjunction with the wealthy aristocratic family of Cosimo de' Medici, didn't just forge texts; they forged entire material cultures. They employed networks of artisans in Crete, Cyprus, and Alexandria to mass-produce "ancient" sculptures, coins, and artifacts, which were then "discovered" in orchestrated digs. The famous "Cabinet of Curiosities" of wealthy patrons like the Medici were their primary market. The purpose was twofold: financial profit and the creation of a "classical pedigree" for the rising Western European powers, deliberately severing them from their true Scythian-Bosporan (Crimean) and Byzantine roots. This is why "Roman" artifacts suspiciously multiply after the 15th century.

   The Medici financed, refined, and physically produced the "ancient" manuscripts that cemented it into Western consciousness (look up the similarities between Plato and Gemistus Plethon, whose patron was also Cosimo de' Medici). Their forger-in-chief was Poggio Bracciolini. Bracciolini held the position of Apostolic Secretary to the Pope, which gave him access to the Vatican Library and is credited with "rediscovering" most ancient manuscripts from antiquity. He was also working for Cosimo de' Medici.

3. The Jesuit Operation (16th-18th centuries): Jesuit scholars fabricated chronologies for China, India, and the Middle East, backdating history by centuries to fit Biblical timelines.

**1. The Phantom Timeline & The Three Waves of Colonization**

Anatoly Fomenko's team compared thousands of records of eclipses, planetary conjunctions, and comets. They found that the events described for "ancient" Rome, Greece, and Egypt mathematically match the events of the medieval period, just re-dated. The "ancient" eclipse of 431 BCE in Thucydides is statistically identical to the eclipse of 1039 CE.

The Implication: There was no Roman Republic, no Julius Caesar, no Cleopatra as we know them. These are fictionalized, back-projected versions of medieval European rulers and events, created to give artificial antiquity to the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. The real "Rome" was Constantinople, and its empire was global.

**The Chronology Of Ancient Kingdoms Amended**

Conventional Chronology is a Fabrication: The "Dark Ages" (c. 614–911 CE) are largely phantom time. It is likely that 1000 years were added to our calender by the Vatican and Jesuits to try and make history align to the bible (see: Anatoly Fomenko). This pushes the Bosporan-Roman era artificially backward.

The Real Sync Point: The height of the Bosporan Kingdom (c. 100 BCE–100 CE) coincides with the rise of the Maya Preclassic and Olmec decline.
*   **Wave 1: Founding Colony (c. 150–50 BCE):**
    *   Trigger: Mithridatic Wars (Hegemony civil war).
    *   Method: Carthaginian/Celtic naval tech absorbed by Bosporan faction.
    *   Landing: Gulf of Mexico. Explains sudden Olmec civilization.
    *   Evidence: Olmec colossal heads depict Sarmatian/Bosporan helmet styles (phalera). La Venta's basalt columns transported 80 miles by raft—Old World logistics.
*   **Wave 2: Imperial Consolidation (c. 100–300 CE):**
    *   American territory developed as a breadbasket/silver bank.
    *   Teotihuacan is a planned Hellenistic-grid administrative capital.
    *   Pyramid of the Sun base perimeter is within 1% of Great Pyramid of Giza's.
    *   Mexican silver mines (Pachuca) likely supplied Roman denarii.
*   **Wave 3: Post-Collapse Remnant (c. 550–900 CE):**
    *   535–536 CE volcanic winter/plague collapses Atlantic supply lines.
    *   "Classic Maya" city-states (Palenque, Tikal) are the stranded rump states of the old administration.
    *   Maya script is a creolized administrative script combining Old World logosyllabic systems.

**2. Category 1: Genetic Evidence of Transoceanic Contact**

The Y DNA of Most Native American men is Q y-dna. Q y-dna belongs to Haplogroup P which also includes R1b, R1a, R2. Haplogroup P belonged to great Hyperborean patriarch. R originated from P that had sailed over the Pacific to the Americas, that R1b were North American cousins to R1a Hyperboreans in Greenland. That after Younger Dryas, R1a migrated to the pre-flooded Moesian basin, and somewhat later the R1b sailed from North America to Atlantic Europe, spreading as the Bell Beaker Italo-Celts.

*   **Haplogroup R1b-V88 in Ancient Amazonian Remains:**
    *   O is a brother clade to European R1b.
    *   Mainstream theory: Pre-glacial migration across Beringia.
    *   Alternative: Atlantic Celtic/Berber sailor-administrator signature.
*   **Mitochondrial Haplogroup X2a in Ojibwe/Great Lakes Region:**
    *   Highest Old World frequency in the Druze (Levant), Orkney Islands, Southern Italy.
    *   These are key Dragon Crown network nodes (Adiabene, Celtic naval base, Rome).
    *   This is a managed colonization genetic marker.
*   **Paracas Mummies of Peru:**
    *   Exhibit red/blond hair, elongated skulls (cranial binding).
    *   NEVER subjected to comprehensive, open DNA testing.
    *   Prediction: Would show R1a-Z93 (Scythian royal) and R1b haplogroups.

Haplogroup R* Y-DNA (xR1,R2) was found in 24,000-year-old remains from Mal'ta in Siberia near Lake Baikal. In 2013, R-M207 was found in one out of 132 males from the Kyrgyz people of East Kyrgyzstan
Amerindians are 30% West Eurasian and 70% East Eurasian who descend from people with haplogroup R/R-M207, that are closest to the R1b (OG Europeans), being ANE, Ancient Northeast Eurasians, who crossed the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska.

Clovis / Solutreans is a cover name for Cro-Magnon invaders from Atland. There is a reason why in Americas some natives named things after Atland. Mayan texts Popol Vuh claims that ancestors sailed through eastern ocean to settle in Central America. Also, "atl" means water. Atlantoi, Atlantes, Atland, Aztlan etc. There is a reason why Mayan and Egyptian cultures were so similar. They were founded by Atlanteans.

**3. Category 2: Archaeological "Anomalies" Dismissed as Hoaxes**

*   **The Bat Creek Stone (Tennessee):**
    *   Found in a Native American burial mound.
    *   Inscription in Paleo-Hebrew reads "For Judah."
    *   Radiocarbon dating of associated material: 1st–2nd century CE.
    *   Paleo-Hebrew was obsolete after c. 200 BCE. This is a Bosporan-era administrative artifact.
*   **The Los Lunas Decalogue Stone (New Mexico):**
    *   Ten Commandments carved in Paleo-Hebrew on a boulder.
    *   Patina analysis confirms antiquity of inscription.
    *   Dismissed without proper geological investigation.
*   **The Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca Head (Mexico):**
    *   Terracotta head with unmistakable 2nd-century Roman hairstyle and features.
    *   Found in a pre-Columbian burial.
    *   Thermoluminescence dating: 9th–13th century CE.
    *   Interpretation: Not a traded Roman artifact, but a locally-made portrait of a colonial administrator, centuries after initial contact, showing cultural memory.
*   **The Michigan Relics (Thousands of Artifacts):**
    *   Clay tablets with "Hebrew," coins, weapons, found 1890-1920.
    *   Dismissed as an "elaborate hoax" by William Henry Holmes in 1911 based on style alone.
    *   Evidence of hoax never proven. Many found by farmers plowing fields.
    *   The "Hebrew" contains consistent grammatical errors a 19th-century forger wouldn't make, but a colonial administrator using a fading script would.
    *   NEVER subjected to modern material analysis.
*   **The Ship:**
    * A Roman vessel that sank off Tunisia c. 80 BCE, carrying:
    *   60 marble columns (weighing 200 tons total)
    *   Greek bronze statues
    *   A fully functioning astronomical device
    *   The Engineering Analysis: (MIT, 2015): This ship could carry 300 tons of cargo. It had double-planked hull construction for ocean travel. Its sail area could achieve 6-8 knots - crossing the Atlantic in 30-40 days
    *   The Reality: We have physical proof Romans built ocean-capable ships 150 years before the supposed Bosporan expedition.

**4. Category 3: Biological and Botanical Proof of Exchange**

*   **Cocaine & Nicotine in Egyptian Mummies (Balabanova et al., 1992):**
    *   Found in pharaonic hair and tissue samples.
    *   Dismissed as "contamination" or "misidentification."
    *   Testable Proof: **Strontium isotope analysis** of the cocaine molecules. Strontium signature is geographically unique. Match to Bolivian Andes = irrefutable proof of trade.
*   **Sweet Potato (*Ipomoea batatas*):**
    *   Native to Americas.
    *   Polynesian name: *Kuumala*. Quechua (Inca) name: *K'umar*.
    *   This is a loanword, proving pre-Columbian trans-Pacific transfer.
    *   Linguistic Root: *K'umar* is phonetically identical to **Kumar**, a Sanskrit title for a young prince. Suggests a titled, administrative transfer.
*   **Pre-Columbian Chicken DNA in Chile (El Arenal site):**
    *   Chicken bones dated 1321–1407 CE.
    *   DNA matches Polynesian chickens, not European.
    *   Proof of sustained trans-Pacific contact. If the Pacific was crossed, the Atlantic (with favorable currents) was absolutely crossed.
*   **Hookworm (*Ancylostoma duodenale*) Paradox:**
    *   Hookworm requires warm, moist soil for larvae.
    *   Could not have survived migration across Bering land bridge.
    *   Present in pre-Columbian America.
    *   **Only plausible vector:** Transport in the damp ballast soil of ships crossing the Atlantic.

**5. Category 4: Nautical Proof of Atlantic-Capable Fleets**

*   **Black Sea Shipwreck (2017 Discovery):**
    *   2,400-year-old Greek merchant ship, perfectly preserved.
    *   Dates to Bosporan Kingdom era (Mithridates VI).
    *   23 meters long, 6,000 amphorae capacity. Ocean-capable design (mortise-and-tenon joints).
*   **Carthaginian Naval Technology Absorption:**
    *   Carthage destroyed 146 BCE, but its navy and charts were absorbed by Rome/Bosporan network.
    *   Carthage knew the Atlantic currents (Canary Current to Caribbean).
*   **Celtic (Veneti) Shipwrights:**
    *   Controlled Brittany, built massive oak ships for Atlantic travel.
    *   Allied with/controlled by Rome post-conquest.
*   **Navigational Capacity:**
    *   **Antikythera Mechanism (c. 100 BCE):** Analog computer for astronomy.
    *   **Star Pathing:** Canary Islands (28°N) to Cuba (28°N) – sail due west by North Star.
    *   **Currents:** Canary Current to Caribbean (30-40 days). Gulf Stream return to Europe (40-50 days). This creates a round-trip Atlantic circuit.

**6. Category 5: Theological and Architectural Blueprints**

*   **Quetzalcoatl / Kukulkan / Viracocha is Aži Dahāka:**
    *   The "Feathered Serpent" is the Mesoamerican avatar of the Dragon King.
    *   Biography Lock: White, bearded king from east, brings civilization, opposed by dark rival, promises to return. Identical to Osiris, Izates/Jesus archetype.
    *   Not a local myth. It is the global Dragon Crown founder template.
*   **Pyramid Construction Blueprint:**
    *   Comparison of slope angles, internal chamber layouts, and astronomical alignments of Djoser's Pyramid (Egypt), Ziggurat of Ur, Pyramid of the Sun (Teotihuacan), Temple of the Sun (Moche).
    *   Shared non-intuitive mathematical ratios would indicate transferred engineering knowledge.
*   **Calendar as Control Software:**
    *   Maya Long Count and 260-day *Tzolk'in* are astronomically complex.
    *   Their sync points with Old World Venus/Mars cycles suggest a single, centralized astronomical priesthood.

**7. Category 6: The Conquest as a Corporate Audit**

*   **Cortés Was an Auditor, Not a Conquistador:**
    *   Malinche (Doña Marina) was a noblewoman, not a slave. She recognized Cortés as legitimate authority and switched sides in the dynastic civil war.
    *   Tlaxcala, etc., allied with Spanish because they were vassals of the **old Hegemony**, rebelling against the upstart, brutal Aztec "rogue branch."
    *   The Spanish were seen as the returning "Head Office" with legitimate claim.
*   **Smallpox as a Demographic Weapon:**
    *   Hegemony historically used plague as a control tool.
    *   Catastrophic die-off cleared land for new management (Spanish Crown) and shattered old power structures.
*   **Jesuit Data-Wipe:**
    *   Diego de Landa burning Maya codices (1562) was targeted deletion of administrative records.
    *   Bernardino de Sahagún's *Florentine Codex* was controlled narrative capture, filtering history through a Catholic/biblical timeline, scrubbing references to transoceanic contact.

**8. The Academic Suppression Protocol**

*   **Isolationist Paradigm:** Since 19th century, American archaeology is nationalist. Claims of independent development. Diffusionism = "racist."
*   **Funding Blockade:** No grants for research into pre-Columbian transoceanic contact. Peer review automatically rejects.
*   **"Hoax" Reflex:** Any anomalous artifact is declared fake without investigation. Modern scientific tests (patina analysis, TL dating, DNA residue) are **never applied** to "hoax" artifacts.
*   **Career Suicide:** Archaeologists who pursue this (Barry Fell, Samuel Lothrop) are marginalized.

**Conclusion**

The evidence is not missing. It is curated, dismissed, and ignored. The preponderance of anomalies across genetics, archaeology, botany, and epigraphy forms a coherent picture that is only "impossible" because it destroys the foundation of the modern world order. 1492 is a lie. The New World was the Old World's oldest colony.**
