1 Pythagoreanism

Pythagoreanism was a philosophical and spiritual movement founded by Pythagoras in the 6th century BCE. Pythagoras believed that numbers and mathematical relationships held the key to understanding the universe and the nature of reality. 

There are only three things that you need to know to understand Pythagoreanism:

1.1 Cosmology

Pythagoras was the founder of monism \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)\]. Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is ultimately one, or that reality is fundamentally unified and that all things are interconnected through a single underlying essence or principle (i.e. materialist/agnostic monists believe this to be energy or matter (1)). Everything in the universe is then seen as emanations or manifestations of this ultimate reality.

1.2 Beliefs

Monist cosmology posits that the universe is composed of a single fundamental substance or reality. This means that the divine is not a separate and transcendent entity but rather an inherent aspect of the universe, and humans are not separate from the divine but rather an unfolding or manifestation of it. Therefore, in monist cosmologies, self-realization or self-actualization is often seen as the process of recognizing and embodying one's true nature as an expression of the divine. This can be seen as a form of self-deification.

1.3 Rituals

In monist religions, rituals are about bringing someone to self-realization. For example, in some Tantric traditions, rituals and practices like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and mantra recitation are designed to help the individual realize their true nature as a manifestation of the divine. The goal is to awaken the individual's inner divinity and are aimed at helping the individual realize their true nature as the ultimate reality. The goal is to transcend the ego and realize one's inherent divinity.

1\. Another way to look at monist cosmology is through the lens of Nietzschean philosophy where the "will to power" \[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power)\] becomes the driving force behind the unfolding of the universe, and by extension, human existence.\
